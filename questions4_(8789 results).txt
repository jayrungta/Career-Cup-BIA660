algorithm					You are given an unsorted binary array. Ex [0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1] and a number K, which represents the number of swap operations allowed on this binary array. you need to find out the maximum length continuous subarray that can be generated using K many swaps. Ex if K = 3 in above case [0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1] => [0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1] => [0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0] => [0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0] so the answer is 9.

algorithm					Delhi Route Traffic Optimizer  Traffic congestion is an annoying issue in Delhi, the capital of India. Every morning thousands of people drivea residential area to the International Technology Park (ITPL). There are various routes one can take to reach ITPL and each route takes its own time making some routes faster than the others. People obviously take faster routes which causes congestion on those roads too. Congestion results into increased travel time, air pollution and wastage of fuel. As a Traffic commissioner of Delhi, you are asked to optimize the traffic by putting toll to various roads so that resultant cost of every route (driving time cost and toll cost) ends up the same. This has to be done in such a way that any driver pays toll only once no matter which route he/she takes.roads have one-way traffic and there is no cycle in any of the routes. You need to create a toll plan for a given road layout.   The toll plan must adhere to following rules:  1. Toll should be levied in such a way that perceived cost (base road cost and toll cost) remains same forroads. 2. The tolls should be levied such that the total cost for each route is minimized. 3. A route cannot have more than one toll. 4. In case of multiple solutions for a route, add toll to a road that is closer to destination.  In some use cases, it might be impossible to impose tolls that satisfy the above conditions.  http://qa.geeksforgeeks.org/11340/delhi-route-traffic-optimizer

algorithm					There are two integer array arrayA and arrayB in the same size and two integer countA and countB. If arrayA[i] > arrayB[i], then we increase countA by 1, if arrayB[i]>arrayA[i], then we increase countB by 1. We will do nothing otherwise. Now you are given arrayA and arrayB, write a function to shuffle arrayA and so you can get countA > countB.

algorithm					You have a range of consecutive numbers, from 1 to n (inclusive). e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4... n]. We would like to calculate a sum of a function across the entire range, where the function returns the product of the preceding C elements.  If there are less than C previous elements, just use the available numbers. i.e. if you are processing the fourth number in the range, but C is greater than 3, then you will calculate the product using only the 3 available preceding numbers. In this situation as you move further along in this range more preceding numbers become available.  A worked example follows: if n=5 and C=2, the correct products and final sum for each element of the range are: 0 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 12 = 21  Can you explain this question and complexity of your algorithm?

algorithm					Early on I prefer to post the interview questions with a simplified description or only present the algorithmic part of it. Because it's hard for our students to memorize the full description of a problem. Therefore often times only the algorithm behind the question is given.  But somehow a user of this site @concernedCoder gets unhappy with it. So from today on, we will try to recover the original version of the question as much as possible.  We assure you all of the questions we posted are real  questions that you have a good chance to come across during a coding interview. Anyone who has experience in a coding interview should be able to see that.   Here is the full description of a recent Amazon OA question. The reason why we are able to provide the full description is because it's the online assessment. But for an on-site interview it's almost impossible to recover the questions perfectly.  Title: Item Recommendations Amazon wants to recommend items to a customer who has just made a purchase. Amazon's recommendation algorithm is based on item 'connection'. Two items are 'strongly connected' if a single customer bought both of them. Two items are 'weakly connected' if they are both strongly and weakly connected to some other third item.  Your  task is to determine the number of the items strongly and weakly connected to a given item.  You are provided the item id represented as a string, as well as the list of customer purchases represented as an array of strings. Each element in the array consists of a customer id(represented as a string) and an item id (also represented as a string). The two ids are separated by a colon. For example, if they element in the array is "ABJA:Z42G" then that means customer ABJA purchased item Z42G. Your output consists of an array, where the first element in the array represents the number of items strongly connected to the provided item id and the second element represents the number of items weakly connected to the provided item id. For example, if you were provided with the following input: determineRecommendation("ABC",["first:ABC", "first:HIJ", "sec:HIJ", "sec:KLM", "third:NOP", "fourth:ABC", "fourth:QRS", "first"DEF", "fifth:KLM", "fifth:TUV"])  You would return the following array: [3, 2] since ABC is strongly connected to 3 items: DEF, HIJ and QRS and is weakly connected to 2 items: KLM and TUV   Although the description is long, the problem is just asking for 'search (with either DFS or BFS) in a graph'.

Example :   given array A[] = [2,4,8,6,7] S[0] = 1 E[0] = 4 H[0] = 5  So, after doing an operation, the resulting array is A[]  = [ 2,4,5,5,5]  Thus, u need to do the same thing for all i.  After doing this, find out the maximum element in the array.

algorithm					Giving a string and an string dictionary, find the longest string in dictionary which can formed by deleting some characters of the giving string. eg:S = abpcplea, Dict = {ale, apple, monkey, plea}, the return "apple"  I was thinking of the following approach,  Build a Trie for all words in the Dict - O( n * k) where k is the longest string in the dict For each character c, in S check if there is a word in Trie that starts with it and has the letters that appear in S after c. We can short circuit based on remaining characters and the length of longest string found so far. This should take O( N * k) where N is length of S.

algorithm					Running with Bunnies ====================  You and your rescued bunny prisoners need to get out of this collapsing death trap of a space station - and fast! Unfortunately, some of the bunnies have been weakened by their long imprisonment and can't run very fast. Their friends are trying to help them, but this escape would go a lot faster if you also pitched in. The defensive bulkhead doors have begun to close, and if you don't make it through in time, you'll be trapped! You need to grab as many bunnies as you can and get through the bulkheads before they close.   The time it takes to move from your starting point to all of the bunnies and to the bulkhead will be given to you in a square matrix of integers. Each row will tell you the time it takes to get to the start, first bunny, second bunny, ..., last bunny, and the bulkhead in that order. The order of the rows follows the same pattern (start, each bunny, bulkhead). The bunnies can jump into your arms, so picking them up is instantaneous, and arriving at the bulkhead at the same time as it seals still allows for a successful, if dramatic, escape. (Don't worry, any bunnies you don't pick up will be able to escape with you since they no longer have to carry the ones you did pick up.) You can revisit different spots if you wish, and moving to the bulkhead doesn't mean you have to immediately leave - you can move to and from the bulkhead to pick up additional bunnies if time permits.  In addition to spending time traveling between bunnies, some paths interact with the space station's security checkpoints and add time back to the clock. Adding time to the clock will delay the closing of the bulkhead doors, and if the time goes back up to 0 or a positive number after the doors have already closed, it triggers the bulkhead to reopen. Therefore, it might be possible to walk in a circle and keep gaining time: that is, each time a path is traversed, the same amount of time is used or added.  Write a function of the form answer(times, time_limit) to calculate the most bunnies you can pick up and which bunnies they are, while still escaping through the bulkhead before the doors close for good. If there are multiple sets of bunnies of the same size, return the set of bunnies with the lowest prisoner IDs (as indexes) in sorted order. The bunnies are represented as a sorted list by prisoner ID, with the first bunny being 0. There are at most 5 bunnies, and time_limit is a non-negative integer that is at most 999.  For instance, in the case of [   [0, 2, 2, 2, -1],  # 0 = Start   [9, 0, 2, 2, -1],  # 1 = Bunny 0   [9, 3, 0, 2, -1],  # 2 = Bunny 1   [9, 3, 2, 0, -1],  # 3 = Bunny 2   [9, 3, 2, 2,  0],  # 4 = Bulkhead ] and a time limit of 1, the five inner array rows designate the starting point, bunny 0, bunny 1, bunny 2, and the bulkhead door exit respectively. You could take the path:  Start End Delta Time Status     -   0     -    1 Bulkhead initially open     0   4    -1    2     4   2     2    0     2   4    -1    1     4   3     2   -1 Bulkhead closes     3   4    -1    0 Bulkhead reopens; you and the bunnies exit  With this solution, you would pick up bunnies 1 and 2. This is the best combination for this space station hallway, so the answer is [1, 2].    Test cases ==========  Inputs:     (int) times = [[0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]]     (int) time_limit = 3 Output:     (int list) [0, 1]  Inputs:     (int) times = [[0, 2, 2, 2, -1], [9, 0, 2, 2, -1], [9, 3, 0, 2, -1], [9, 3, 2, 0, -1], [9, 3, 2, 2, 0]]     (int) time_limit = 1 Output:     (int list) [1, 2]

If two consecutive substrings are magical, then we can swap the substrings as long as the resulting string is still a magical string. Given a magical binary string, str, perform zero or more swap operations on its consecutive magical substrings such that the resulting string is aslexicographically large as possible. Two substrings are considered to be consecutive if the last character of the first substring occurs exactly one index before the first character of the second substring.  -----  Input Format a single binary string, str.  Constraints It is guaranteed that str is a binary string of 1's and 0's only. 1  length(str)  50 It is guaranteed that str is a magical string.  Output Format Find a string denoting the lexicographically largest magical string that can be formed from str.  Sample Input 0 11011000  Sample output 11100100  Explanation of sample Given the magical string str = 11011000, we can choose two consecutive magical substrings, 1100 and 10, to swap such that the resultant string, str' = 11100100, is the lexicographically largest possible magical string possible. Thus, we return the value of str', which is 11100100, as our answer.  .

algorithm					We tend to use computer to solve practical problems that actually earns or save dollars. Here is something that happens across the stock exchanges : people buy and sell stocks. We generally use automated intelligent systems to buy and sell stocks. That part is too much mathematics, and beyond scope of this interview. There is another part. Suppose the system issues a buy order : buy 1000 Microsoft stock. Now, there are more than 1 ( in fact 10 ) active exchanges from where we can buy MSFT.  There is a slight price delta, which keeps changing over time. There is another problem. In each stock exchange, prices are stacked, that is : 1. For first 100 stocks prices are 55$. 2. Next 200 stocks, prices are 55.2$. ... etc, and you got the idea. Even this stacks are changing over time.  Thus, here is the problem to solve. Design and implement a system such that one can buy  n stocks with minimal price. Also, in the same spirit, the same system should be able to sell n stocks with maximum payoff possible.  This is a non trivial problem, for Quant systems. There are always k no of exchanges to hit.

algorithm					As you know, Computers were invented to solve practical business problems, we tend to ask practical applied questions. One of the key areas where we want to apply computers is simulation. As most of the people working in software are Engineers, here is the problem. It is called 3 body problem. 3 Bodies with masses [ m1, m2, m3 ] are initially positioned in the 3 points in the space, thus, having positions [ P1, P2, P3 ]. Observe that each Pi is nothing but [ xi, yi, zi ].  Once the initial condition is set, definitely gravity would work and they would start falling against each other. Write code to simulate this problem. Imagine G, the constant of gravity as 1.  How do you go about simulating it? Hint : feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_09.html see 9.5   Face to face. Pen and Paper.

In fact they are so slow that very serious people who wants to do volumes of read operation and search operations write their own implementation.

algorithm					You are given 20 questions to solve in 20 minutes. If you successfully solve the question, you would receive 2 marks. If you failed to solve the question, and you do not try it  ( let it untouched ) , you would receive  0 marks. If you solve it wrong ( i.e. not the correct answer ) - you would receive -1 ( negative) . With the story, here are the problems:  1. Write an algorithm, which, given an input array ( set )  of questions, and varying probability ( 0 <= p <= 1 )  of can do and can not do per question, generates a strategy for solving the paper to generate maximum expected pay off.  2. Given the question paper is multiple choice, between 4 choices ( a,b,c,d )  do a bias analysis ( e.g. if more a's are coming than 'c's ), and decide if you would like to probabilistically take risk and mark some to increase pay off.  Obviously, you can get a maximum 40, and a minimum -20.  3. Now, put yourself in the position of the examiner, and try to ensure it is almost impossible to increase payoff by random selection over the questions. Try to negate the bias. That is question 3.  In all 3 cases write an algorithm. Face to face interview, time allocated was 60 minutes. Panel Interview.

The city is built just like a 2-D array and each house owner kept certain amount for Mickey (for ex: The house owner at (i,j) coordinate kept A[i,j] for Mickey). Mickey is in a hurry and he wants to reach home as soon as possible otherwise he will miss the match between India and Bangladesh. Also he can only move to any adjacent house from his location, and he cannot move diagonally. So please find a way so that he will collect maximum amount from everyone if he will reach home earliest.  *Input Specification* input1 = first input will tell you size of the array input2 = String as shown in the example and you have to parse it to build your 2-D array  *Output Specification* output1 = You need to set maximum amount collected to this global variable (type int)  *Example* Consider input1 = 4 and it means school is at (0,0) and his house is at (4,4).

algorithm					We define a subarray of array to be a contiguous block of a's elements having a length that is less than or equal to the length of array a. For example, the subarray of array a = [1,2,3] are [1], [2], [1,2], [2,3], and [1,2,3]. Now, let's say we have an integer, k = 3. The subarrays of a having elements that sum to a number <=k are [1], [2], and [1,2]. The longest of these subarrays is [1,2], which had a length of 2.  Complete the maxLength function in the editor. It has 2 parameters :   1. An array of integers, a.   2. An integer, k The function must return the length of the longest subarray elements that sum to a number less than or equal to k.  Input Format Locked stub code in the editor reads the following input from stdin and passes it to the function: The first line contains a single ineteger n, denoting the number of elements in array a. Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 <=i < n) contains an integer describing elements i in array a. Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 <= i <= n) contains an integer describing elements i in array a. The last line contains an integer, k.

algorithm					You are currently in practice mode. This is a demo only.  A zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. An equilibrium index of this array is any integer P such that 0  P < N and the sum of elements of lower indices is equal to the sum of elements of higher indices, i.e.  A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[P1] = A[P+1] + ... + A[N2] + A[N1]. Sum of zero elements is assumed to be equal to 0. This can happen if P = 0 or if P = N1.  For example, consider the following array A consisting of N = 8 elements:    A[0] = -1   A[1] =  3   A[2] = -4   A[3] =  5   A[4] =  1   A[5] = -6   A[6] =  2   A[7] =  1 P = 1 is an equilibrium index of this array, because:  A[0] = 1 = A[2] + A[3] + A[4] + A[5] + A[6] + A[7] P = 3 is an equilibrium index of this array, because:  A[0] + A[1] + A[2] = 2 = A[4] + A[5] + A[6] + A[7] P = 7 is also an equilibrium index, because:  A[0] + A[1] + A[2] + A[3] + A[4] + A[5] + A[6] = 0 and there are no elements with indices greater than 7.  P = 8 is not an equilibrium index, because it does not fulfill the condition 0  P < N.  Write a function:  int solution(int A[], int N);  that, given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns any of its equilibrium indices. The function should return 1 if no equilibrium index exists.  For example, given array A shown above, the function may return 1, 3 or 7, as explained above.  Assume that:  N is an integer within the range [0..100,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647]. Complexity:  expected worst-case time complexity is O(N); expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments). Elements of input arrays can be modified.

algorithm					I was asked in an interview: You are given a dump file of IPv4 addresses. You are to find 4 most common occurring subnets. Lets say an IP address if of type a.b.c.d you have to find most common occurring four subnets of the form,  a.*.*.*  a.b.*.*  a.b.c.*  a.b.c.d  Here * matches anything.  My first solution was build an in memory hashtable. Given an IP address a.b.c.d split it as ["a","b","c","d"] and add "a", "a.b", "a.b.c", "a.b.c.d" to the hash table and count it. [There are optimizations possible like considering the entire IP address as a 32 bit unsigned integer and count it with masks and shifts]  Then the question got extended: "assume you can never hold everything in memory, how would you solve it?" Now, the very first solution that I could say was to do an external sort and then count it.  The next solution I gave was to split the IP addresses into buckets. The algorithm was,

There are n students in the class and each student is identified by his/her student ID, which is between 1 and n. The coach has to select K players out of these n students for his team. But there is a twist, if among the K dodgeball players, a player's ID number evenly divides another player's ID number, then there is a high chance of them getting into a fight. The coach will do his best to select the K players so that no pair of players among them will want to fight one another. But if the game turns out to be very popular, this becomes impossible. Complete the function dodgeBall to return the minimum size of K at which it becomes impossible to choose a  dodgeball team that has no fighting?  Input Format: One line of text, containing the size of the class of 2013, n  Constraints: 1 <= n <= 5,000,000,000 n is guaranteed to be an even number  Output Format: The minimum size of K that guarantees the existence of 2 players who fight with each other in any K-sized subset of the class.  Sample Input: 4  Sample Output: 3  Explanation: If the team = {1,2,3}: 1&2 or 1&3 can fight with each other If the team = {1,3,4}: 1&3 or 1&4 can fight with each other If the team = {2,3,4}: 2&4 can fight with each other If K=2, then the teams {3,4} or {2,3} will have no fights. So 3 is the smallest value of K for which any K-sized team, must include a fighting pair.  Sample Input: 2  Sample Output: 2  Explanation: The team = {1,2}: 1&2 can fight with each other

algorithm					There is down-turn in the ship-building industry. Ace Shipping Corp (ASC) wants to be prepared by having a system that will help evaluate the total cost saving they will achieve if they were to let go some employees.  Following are the rules for drawing up this Firing List:  Each manager at every level in the organization will have to contribute heads from his team to the firing list  The input to the system would be a small integer k (=1,2, etc) which would be the number of employees chosen per manager. The output would be the total cost saved for this k. Different values of k would give an idea of the total cost saving achieved.  The primary selection criteria is Performance Rating. k employees with the minimum rating under a given manager are to be selected.  If two employees have the same rating, the one with the higher salary gets selected (to maximize cost saved)  The activity might be requested for the sub-org under any manager. The default is to consider the entire org.  Although total number of reportees for a manager is usually of the order of 10, it could possibly be a much larger number in some org too. An optimal way of choosing the k reportees would be preferred.  The following information needs to get stored per Employee:  Employee ID (unique)  Name  Performance Rating (1-5, 1 is lowest, 5 is highest)  Salary (Rs)

Sure, if you want. But there are a number of things we'd like to achieve:   The container will be in memory and will need to hold lots of data, so we'd like it to be as space  efficient as possible, but not to the extent where speed is significantly compromised. Speed is  king, memory/disk can be purchased.   Since we hate collecting garbage, we need to be careful about memory allocation during a query, as  my grandmother told me, "allocate not, gc not".   Code should be clear and understandable.   The rough order of trade off to consider for this case is: search performance, efficient  usage of memory, simplicity and maintainability of the code  These objectives are often at odds - we'd like to explore what's possible.

algorithm					Given an array of five integers that represents a poker hand e.g. [2,2,2,3,3] return the value of the hand, valid values are only "pair","two pairs","three of a kind","full house","four of a kind" we don't have to worry about straight, flush or straight flush.  My approach was to have a fixed array of 13 elements (each element represents one possible value of the hand) this array will keep the occurrence of each value of our hand and after we have all the values we just iterate this array and multiply all the values by itself and adding them to get a unique result.  For example if we have [2,2,3,4,5] our fixed array will have a "2" and three "1" so our result will be "2*2+1*1+1*1+1*1",the result will be 7, so all the possible hands will have unique values, if we find a 7 as a result we will know it is a pair, a 9 will be two pairs, a 11 will be three of a kind, 13 will be a full house and 17 will be a four of a kind.  This algorithm is O(1) both in complexity and space but the  interviewer didn't like it too much.

algorithm					Assume that garbage collector is not there in place or you are implementing a garbage collector for C++. Write the design and sample code for garbage collector implementation  We have 3 classed and Class A, B, C. object of A uses object B and Object of B uses Object of C.

Answer which I suggested : Write a tree (or Graph?)data structure (Garbage collector is a container class holds this data structure)  where each node has multiple paths to reach. If any of the node is not having a path to reach then we can clean that memory. This way the garbage collection will work. Please suggest your design as well.

algorithm					We have a long string. We label some substrings with tags.   - A tag entry is [startIndex, endIndex, tag]. - Query: 1 or more tags - Output: all blocks/ranges with all queried tags.

Please describe your algorithm before posting code.  **Edit**: To add some difficulties, partial overlap is treated the same as full overlap, ONLY the overlapped part matches both tags. E.g. if we have entries:      [23, 72, 0]	// label [23, 72) with tag 0     [10, 53, 1]	// label [34, 53) with tag 1  Query and Output:     0,1 => [23,53]	// [23, 53) matches both tag 0 and 1  Minor detials: Note in the comments we used open range on the right, i.e. if the string named "str", [23, 72, 0] includes str[23] but NOT str[72]; and there's no overlap between the following entries: [23, 72, 0] [10, 23, 0]

algorithm					You are given a rectangular grid with 2 rows and N columns. The top row is labeled 1 and the bottom row is labeled 2. The columns are labeled from 1 to N in increasing order. Each cell in the grid contains a single character. Consider a hamiltonian walk in this grid. Meaning, pick a starting cell, say (i,j), and consider a path that starts from (i,j) and goes through every cell in the grid exactly once. Note that you can only walk to adjacent cells, or cells that you share a common edge with. There may be several such paths. Let us concatenate the characters in the order in which the cells are visited during a walk. The string formed can be called the string for the walk. Among all the possible walks, and their respective strings, find out the lexicographically smallest string. We know that the length of the strings are all the same - to be precise, 2N. Thus, the lexicographically smallest string is simply the alphabetically smallest string if you compare the characters from left to right. Input The first line of input contains a number T, the number of test cases. Then follow T test cases. Each test case contains 3 lines. The first line contains the number N, the number of columns in the grid. It is well known of course that the grid contains 2 rows. The next two lines contain the description of the grid in the form of two strings; the string of N characters in row 1 from left to right and the string of N characters in row 2 from left to right, respectively. Each character will be a lowercase english letter. Output Output a single line for each test case. The line must contain a string with 2N characters. This string should be the lexicographically smallest string for some hamiltonian walk in the grid. Constraints 1  T  100 1  N  10    Sample Input 2 3 abc def 10 ababaaabab bababababa    Sample Output abcfed aaababababababababab    Explanation In the first test the possible strings are { abcfed, adebcf, adefcb, badefc, bcfeda, cbadef, cfedab, cfebad, dabcfe, dabefc, defcba, edabcf, efcbad, fedabc, fcbade, fcbeda }.

Suppose there are 3 cities and 2 highways. The highway between City 1 and City 2 is 200 miles and the highway between City 2 and City 3 is 300 miles. So the THD is 1000(200 + 500 + 300) miles because the distances between City 1 and City 2, City 1 and City 3, City 2 and City 3 are 200 miles, 500 miles and 300 miles respectively.

algorithm					Write a program that takes as its input an arbitrarily long sequence of words where each word has arbitrary length and is limited to the 26 characters (a-z).  The output of this program is a Boolean value for each input word.  TRUE if the word is an anagram of any of the previous inputs, and FALSE otherwise.  The program should read its input from a file of newline separated words and write its output to standard out.  The program should make efficient use of memory and perform well with large data sets.  Provide some test cases to demonstrate that the code works as expected.  Also, please provide a written explanation of your approach to the problem, your thought process in your choice of data structures and algorithms (including any choices you considered and rejected), design tradeoffs, and why you expect your design to perform well with very large data sets.  How does the memory footprint scale with the number of words and the word lengths? How does the response time scale with the number of words and word lengths? The answers to these scalability questions depend not only on the program design, but on the nature of the input sets.  Complete and precise treatments are a major undertaking, but take it as far as you can go.  If you make any simplifying assumptions about the input distributions, call them out.  Can you make empirical measurements to verify your scalability theories?  If you don't have time to make those measurements, explain how you would go about collecting the data.

Bunch of wires is coming into a single large channel from the Huge pool of wires is divided to a set of smaller channels  the clasp(if open electricity can pass through channel else not) at the junction controls which smaller channels receive the electricity. Each smaller channel then divides the wires into even smaller channels  controlled by the clasp, and so on  till it reaches the destination nodes(homes/offices etc).  Develop an system and algorithm for "electricity division system " It is following constraints:   Each channel must have a minimum number of  wires Each channel can not receive more than a maximum number of wires If a channel does not need any electricity , wires going through that channel that would have gone towards the minimum number of that wires can be divided into other channels. 4.The channels pass through multiple types of resources. The restriction is that  channels that are blue must be given priority over channels those are red.   Is it possible to develop a system such that once the single large channel  divides wires to the 1st channel, the current never stops till it reaches the destination resource? If not, then why? If yes, then develop the algorithm and write the code for such a system.

algorithm					The King's Land Sale - 2 You might have seen shopkeepers offering sale on their trade items to promote their business - like sale on electronic gadgets or sale on clothing and accessories etc. But have you ever come across something like sale of land ?  Yes, the king of Byteland has grown old and wants to sell away his territory as soon as possible. So he announced a sale on his plot. This drew attention of many land lords and everybody hurried to buy land at the cheapest prices. The king had declared that he would accept bids of only rectangular plots and one needs to mention the diagonally opposite corners(a, b) and (c, d) of the land he wishes to buy. They would write these 4 numbers (a, b, c, d) on a piece of paper, seal it in an airtight envelope and give it to the king.  The king received N such envelopes. As the process was hidden there were many envelopes containing plot descriptions that shared some (or even all) common area. The king now wants to know the union of the areas of all plots that have come under the bidding.  Note that the rectangles made by the plots are always aligned to the rectangular axes, their areas is always positive and c >= a and d >= b.  Note that the rectangles made by the plots are always aligned to the rectangular axes, their areas is always positive and c >= a and d >= b.  Constraints  1  T  20  1  N  20  -10000  a, b, c, d  10000  Input  The first line of the input contains the number of test cases T. The description of T test cases follow. Each test case starts with a line containing an integer N, the number of rectangular plots. Then N lines follow, each with 4 space separated integers, a b c d,(a, b) and (c, d) representing the diagonally opposite corners of the plots.  Output  For each test case print one line, the union of the areas of all the plots.    Explanation  1) The individual areas of both plots are 4 each. But they share a common area of 1 between them (between (1, 1) and (2, 2)). Therefore the total area is 4 + 4 - 1 = 7  2)Both the plots of no area in common. So we simply add their individual areas (6 + 9 = 15).

algorithm					I came across this problem online.  > Given an integer:N and an array int arr[], you have to add some > elements to the array so that you can generate from 1 to N by using > (add) the elements in the array.  Please keep in mind that you can only use each element in the array once when generating a certain x (1<=x<=N). Return the count of the least adding numbers.      For example:      N=6, arr = [1, 3]       1 is already in arr.       add 2 to the arr.       3 is already in arr       4 = 1 + 3       5 = 2 + 3       6 = 1 + 2 + 3       So we return 1 since we only need to add one element which is 2.  Can anyone give some hints?

algorithm					Minimum number of jumps required to climb stairs  Its basically like, you have 2 parallel staircases and both the staircases have n steps. You start from the bottom and you may move upwards on either of the staircases. Each step on the staircase has a penalty attached to it. You can also move across both the staircases with some other penalty.  I had to find the minimum penalty that will be imposed for reaching the top.  I tried writing a recurrence relation but I couldn't write anything because of so many variables.  I recently read about dynamic programming and I think this question is related to that.

algorithm					Problem Statement Given a stream of numbers, write code to calculate the rolling average and rolling maximum over two different window sizes. We provide an illustrative example below. It illustrates the expected output for window sizes of 3 and 5. For your solution please implement a solution that uses window sizes of 3 and 20. For example, given a stream containing the following values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] the following tuples would be expected, where None indicates that a value is not available, and would be NaN in some languages: (None, None, None, None)(None, None, None, None)(2, 3, None, None)(3, 4, None, None)(4, 5, 3, 5)(5, 6, 4, 6)  You should write a class which accepts an iterator and acts as a generator which yields tuples as shown above. C++ guidance This is a sample interface for C++; you may use any functionally equivalent interface that you wish. Your implementation would accept an InputStream reference and implement StatisticsGenerator. structStatistics { boolvalid;// true only if mean and max fields are valid doublemean; doublemax; }; classStatisticsGenerator { public: // Returns true if more elements are available boolHasNext(); // Get the current statistics. std::pair<Statistics, Statistics> GetNext(); }; classInputStream { public: // Returns true if more elements are available boolHasNext(); // Get the next element in the stream doubleGetNext(); };

Maga is at the left-top and wants to go to right-bottom. But there is a condition. Maga can go through only two way - right and down. And the path of your move is called the nodes you have passed through over them. The path is called the most beautiful if the following condition is satisfied: The sorted of the path has to be lexicographic smallest as possible as. Output the most beautiful path for given grid.  Input: In the first line you are given two numbers: the dimensions of grid - n and m. The next n lines contains m numbers. Each number is unique.  Output: Output the most beautiful path.  Contraints: 1 <= n,m <= 1000 1 <= A[i][j] <= n*m, All of the numbers in the grid are unique.   Sample Input 2 2 4 2 3 1  Sample Output 1 2 4  Explanation There are 2 ways to reach at (2,2) cell. The pathes are 4, 3, 1 or 4, 2, 1 respectively. So The most beautiful of them is 4, 2, 1 because if looking the sorted of them it looks like these : 1, 3, 4 and 1, 2, 4 respectively. So 1, 2, 4 is lexicographic smaller than the other. So the ans is 1 2 4.

algorithm					Little Chandan is a friend everyone feels lucky to have. He is a happy-go-lucky-fellow and makes sure that everyone around him is happy. But recently, he came to know that his friend little Arjit is in serious trouble, and needs help. Like the great friend little Chandan is, he took the challenge upon himself without any serious thought, to make sure that little Arjit feels fine.  Now, little Arjit explains the story of his problems (His life, in general!) to let little Chandan figure out his troubles. After all, everyone needs help. All little Arjit needs is to get an internship somewhere, and complete his dual degree course, somehow, anyhow.  Little Chandan being the great genius man with psychic power decides to enter the brain of his friend to help him out.  Here are the contents of little Arjit's brain: - His goals. (Internship, dual degree, remember?) - what Chandan needs to free. - Predictable empty spaces in his brain - plain empty spaces. - Ex-girlfriends and their memories - which CANNOT be penetrated, while traversing. - Windows which lead to the goal - which need to be open for little Chandan to pass.  Little Chandan knows the location of the two goals in his brain, the problem is while traveling through the path of his brain he'll have to break down the windows - once he has opened a window to cross that path, it remains open forever. So, he wants to minimize the number of windows he opens inside his friend's mind.  Help him plan his path accordingly, so he ends up breaking the minimum number of windows!  Input Format: - First line contains a number t, denoting the number of test cases. - Every test case will have the following: - One line with two integers hm, wm - determining the width of the brain and the height of the brain.  The following characters define the state: - X is the space which cannot be penetrated filled by the memories of ex-girlfriends. - W is the windows which little Chandan need to cross to reach the goal. - . is an empty space in the brain. - G are the two goals to be rescued.  Output Format: 1. Minimum number of windows Chandan needs to open to get to both the goals in Arjit's mind.  Constraints: 1 <= t <= 100 2 <= hm, wm <= 100  There are EXACTLY two goals in his mind. For each goal, a path from the outside to that goal is surely going to exist. Chandan can move around freely outside the mind.    Sample Input 1 5 9 XXXXWXXXX X..W.W..X XXXX.XXXX XGW.W.WGX XXXXXXXXX  Sample Output 4

algorithm					Write an algorithm to create tables of a given set of players (i.e divide the players into groups) for a game in the following manner. Each table will have 6 players. Total number of players will be a multiple of 6. There are some conditions that must be fulfilled to decide which player takes which table. These conditions are defined later and requires some definitions that we will look into first.  'Distance' between the players: Since these players have been playing with each other in the past, we have history (available in a data set) about who played with whom in the past. Using this player game history we can plot a graph of players where each player is a node in the graph. A player is connected to another player if they have played on the same table in the past. In such a case distance between them is 1.   For example: If Pi and Pj have played on the same table in the past then they are connected with each other and 'Distance' between Pi and Pj is 1. Distance between any 2 players is defined as length of the shortest path between 2 players. If 2 players are not connected then distance between them is same as maximum of distance between any 2 players + 1  Degree of separation of a table Degree of separation of a table is defined as sum of (Distances of all players taken 2 at a time) Example: For a table of 6 players: Degree of separation = Sum of all 15 distances (6 choose 2)  The condition on table formation is: We have to create tables (i.e divide the players into groups) such that Sum of (degree of separation of all the tables) is minimum.  The constraints on data size: Number of history records is upto 100M records Number of unique players in history upto 200K Number of tables possible in the solution is upto 1K

algorithm					Design an object oriented console application named universe that reads in a file containing the schema of a two dimensional (2D) universe and outputs certain information about the universe. A 2D universe is a simplified universe that contains galaxies, stars, and planets, all of which are located on a flat plane specified using 2-coordinates (x-axis and y-axis).  There is only one universe and it contains one or more galaxies.  A galaxy may contain one or more stars located in it.  A star may contain zero or more planets located near it in the same galaxy.  A planet may belong to one or two stars located near it in the same galaxy (Planet E465D in the sample file below is an example).  In order to allow the objects to support more descriptive attributes and functionality in future revisions of the application, all the object types described above should be represented using separate classes. Parent-Child relationships should also be represented using links between the various object instances. The program will run with three arguments specified: the input-file, and the name of two objects of any type, A and B.  Example command-line: universe text.txt Alpha_Dra E465D Based on the command line arguments specified, the program will compute and display: 1. The parents location for both object A and B. (If needed, assume the coordinate of the universe is 0,0) 2. The minimum distance between object A (Alpha_Dra) and B (E465D). This is the distance between the two objects given locations. 3. Any of the two closest stars in the entire universe. 4. The farthest object from A, that is of the same type as A; and the farthest object from B, that is of the same type as B. (if one exists) The input file contains new-line separated lines each describing one object using the format:  Type|Unique-Name|X-Coordinate|Y-Coordinate|Parents-Name| Example test.txt input file: Galaxy|Draco|75434.2|89151.4|Universe| Star|Beta_And|23315.83|-2234.73|Andromeda| Star|Alpha_Dra|75243.25|84123|Draco| Galaxy|Andromeda|2967.78|-2357.2|Universe| Planet|P165EU|75242.42|84121.2|Alpha_Dra| Star|Alpha_And|26413.83|-2727.73|Andromeda| Planet|E465D|26412.4|-2726.51|Alpha_And| Planet|E465D|26412.4|-2726.51|Beta_And| Notes:  The Universe object that serves as a parent to the galaxies is implicit, and will not be explicitly defined in the input file.

algorithm					Description  A prospective CS student is investigating how many semesters it will take to graduate from a variety of different universities. Each university provides a list of required courses, their prerequisites, and when each course is offered. Given this information, determine the minimum number of semesters to graduate.  Consider the following example. A student is required to take 4 courses, mt42, cs123, cs456, and cs789. mt42 is only offered in the fall semester and has no prerequisites. Similarly, cs123 is only offered in the spring semester and has no prerequisites. cs456 is only offered in the spring semester and has both cs123 and mt42 as prerequisites. Finally, cs789 is offered in both fall and spring and has cs456 as its only prerequisite. The shortest time to graduate is 5 semesters, by taking mt42 in the fall, cs123 in the next spring, cs456 the following spring (since it is not offered in the fall) and finally cs789 the following fall.  For this problem, there are only two semesters, fall and spring. Always start counting semesters from the fall.  In addition to the fall/spring scheduling issues, there is one slight complication. In order to keep the dormitories full, each university limits the number of courses that can be taken in any semester. This limit appears as part of the input data. The third example below illustrates this issue.  Input  There are one to twenty-five data sets, followed by a final line containing only the integers -1 -1. A data set starts with a line containing two positive integers n, 1 <= n <= 12, which is the number of courses in this data set and m, 2 <= m <= 6, which is the maximum number of courses that can be taken in any single semester. The next line contains the n course identifiers. Each is a 1-5 character string from the set {a-z, 0-9}. Following the course identifiers is the individual course information. This consists of n lines, one line for each course, containing the course identifier, semester offered ('F'=Fall, 'S'=Spring, 'B'=Both semesters), the number of prerequisite courses, p, 0 <= p <= 5, and finally p prerequisite course identifiers. The first example data set below corresponds to the problem described above.  Output  The output contains one line for each data set, formatted as shown in the sample output.  Sample Input  4 6 cs123 mt42 cs456 cs789 mt42 F 0 cs123 S 0 cs456 S 2 cs123 mt42 cs789 B 1 cs456 3 6 math1 comp2 comp3 comp3 S 1 comp2 math1 S 0 comp2 F 1 math1 4 3 m10 m20 c33 c44 m10 B 0 m20 B 0 c33 B 0 c44 B 0 -1 -1 Sample Output  The minimum number of semesters required to graduate is 5. The minimum number of semesters required to graduate is 4. The minimum number of semesters required to graduate is 2.

algorithm					Say you have a keypad that has keys for the numbers 0 through 9 and the correct code is some sequence of 5 digits. This keypad does *not* reset after entering an incorrect sequence of 5 digits. ie. If the correct sequence is 12345, entering 7512345 will succeed in opening it because it ends in the correct sequence. If the keypad actually resets after every 5 digits pressed, then it would not succeed b/c it would interpret the above sequence as "75123" then "45".  1. Write an algorithm that will try to find the correct code for this keypad. Assume you have an API similar to KeyPad.pressKey(int n) where you pass in a number (0...9) and it returns true if the keypad unlocks and false if it's still locked.  Note that you could easily enter all digits of all numbers 00000 through 99999 resulting in 5*100000 key presses, but remember that the panel does not reset after every sequence of 5 digits, so find a way to do this more efficiently. Notice for example that entering the stream 3791283780 will test the length 5 sequences 37912, 79128, 91283, 12837, 28378, 83780; not only the two disjoint sequences 37912 and 83780.  Think of this keypad as remembering the last 4 keys pressed (and the order pressed); when the next key is pressed, if the last 4 keys + the current key equal the correct code, the keypad will unlock. Assume the keypad does all this internally, so you can just keep feeding it keypresses and it will eventually unlock if the last 5 keypresses entered is the correct code.  2. Generalize your algorithm to work for a keypad where you don't know the length of the correct sequence in advance.

algorithm					In the game of Jack Straws, a number of plastic or wooden "straws" are dumped on the table and players try to remove them one-by-one without disturbing the other straws. In the question here, we are concerned with the following, related problem: First n straws are dumped on the table. Next, for every pair of straws, we want to determine if the straws are connected by a path of touching straws. In other words, given a list of the endpoints for n > 1 straws (as if they were dumped on a large piece of graph paper), determine all the pairs of straws that are connected. Note that touching is connecting, but also two straws can be connected indirectly via other connected straws. Give an algorithm to compute all the pairs of straws that are connected. Here is some additional information that you can use:   As a basic step you need to determine whether two straws directly touch (intersect), i.e., whether straw ab with end points a and b intersects with straw cd (with end points c and d). To get full credit also explain how the elementary step i) can be done. If you cannot find an algorithm for this step, assume an O(n 2 ) algorithm and explain how to find all pairs of straws that are connected. Analyse and explain the worst-case computational complexity of your algorithm in terms of n.

algorithm					Your job is to build a data structure to maintain a set of photographs. Your photograph database should allow you to insert and search for photographs, as well as to designate some of the photographs as favourites by marking them. In more detail, your data structure should support the following operations:  Insert(x, t, m): inserts photograph x that was taken at time t. If m = 1, then the photograph is marked as a favourite; if m = 0, then it is not a favourite.  Search(t): find the next photograph taken after time t.  NextFavorite(t): find the next photograph taken after time t that is a favourite.  Give a data structure for solving this problem, and explain how it works. For more efficiency, your data structure should be both time and space efficient: more points will be given for more efficient solutions. (Remember that the photographs themselves may be quite large.) Give the performance (i.e., running time) of each operation and the space usage of the data structure. You may assume that at any given time t, your camera has taken at most one photograph x. Describe your solution in words, or very high-level pseudocode. You do not need to provide complete details. You must provide enough detail, however, that your solution is clear.

algorithm					There is a zoo and there are several groups(number of groups:K) of people for tour. Each group is having different size (g1,g2,g3gK). There is one bus with capacity C. Journey starts from a point and bus will come back to the same point. A group can only be included in the bus if all the members of the groups can be accumulated in bus. After coming back from the tour, each group in the bus will again wait in the queue at the bus-stand. Bus-driver earns a rupee for each person travelled. You have to find the earning of the bus driver after R rounds.  For example :  Number of groups G = 4  Group size for each group : 2 4 3 5  Bus capacity : 7  Number of rounds R : 4    queue : (from front side) 2 4 3 5  First round : 2 4 (we cant take 3rd group as 3 members cant be accumulated after 2 and 4.)  queue : 3 5 2 4 (1st and 2nd group are enqueued. i.e. 2 and 4)  Second round : 3  queue : 5 2 4 3  Third Round : 5 2  queue : 4 3 5 2  Fourth Round : 4 3  After 4 rounds, total earning is 6+3+7+7 = 23.

algorithm					Assume you have a starting 4 digit number, say 1234 and and ending 4 digit number 4567. For changing a bit of a number from 1 to 3 (for example), it will take 2 steps (from 1->2 and from 2->3). So to convert 1234 to 4567, youll have to change each and every bit individually in some number of steps. (Change 1->4 in 3 steps, 2->5 in 3 steps and so on). Now there is a list of blacklisted numbers. So while transforming start to end, if you reach a blacklisted number, then you cannot change that particular bit, youll have to move to another bit. E.g. Assume 1434 is a blacklisted number, and while transforming you reach it, then you have to change either 1, or 3 or the last 4. So you have to find the least number of steps in which start number can be transformed to end number.

algorithm					There is a n player game of cards. The deck of card is not fair, i.e. any card can be there any number of times. A card has a number and a color. Each player gets k card each (n and k can be harcoded in the solution). The computer starts the game by throwing a card from the deck of cards. Assume the card is 4 of Green. Then the other player has to throw either a 4 of any color or Green of any number. If the player does not have any such card, then it can say pass. The player who finishes all his card wins. The logic of selecting the card by the user can be hardcoded (Eg, If you use a list data structure for storing the cards for a player, then you can say that the player always throws the first card from the list). The logic was required only to start and conclude the game.

Your solution should include working data structures to represent the spreadsheet and operate on a "entire" spreadsheet to indicate which cells have circular dependencies.  Spreadsheet  The spreadsheet is a collection of cells within a 2-D space of columns and rows.  Columns are defined with a letter and rows are defined by a number.  You can assume an upper limit of 26 columns for simplicity.  Cell values are either a number (long or double) or an expression containing numbers, operators, and references to other cells (i.e. B2 means the second column [B] and second row [2]).  You can ignore the parsing of expressions for this exercise.  Instead, your solution can define the data you will work with after expressions have been parsed.  Cycles  A cycle occurs when a cell refers to itself either directly or indirectly via an expression.

algorithm					In a Formula-1 challenge, there are n teams numbered 1 to n. Each team has a car and a driver. Cars specification are as follows:   Top speed: (150 + 10 * i) km per hour  Acceleration: (2 * i) meter per second square.  Handling factor (hf) = 0.8  Nitro : Increases the speed to double or top speed, whichever is less. Can be used only once.  Here i is the team number. The cars line up for the race. The start line for (i + 1)th car is 200 * i meters behind the ith car.  All of them start at the same time and try to attain their top speed. A re-assessment of the positions is done every 2 seconds(So even if the car has crossed the finish line in between, youll get to know after 2 seconds). During this assessment, each driver checks if there is any car within 10 meters of his car, his speed reduces to: hf * (speed at that moment). Also, if the driver notices that he is the last one on the race, he uses nitro.  Taking the number of teams and length of track as the input, Calculate the final speeds and the corresponding completion times.

algorithm					Rahul is playing a very interesting game. He has some N different type of match boxes. All match boxes may have different number of matchsticks (S1, S2, S3... Sn).  Rahul chooses two random numbers F and K. K should be less than N. The game is that Rahul wants to select any K match boxes out of N match boxes such that total number of matchsticks in these K selected match boxes should be multiple of F. At the sametime Rahul wants that sum matchsticks of all the selected match boxes should be minimum possible.   Input Specifications: 1) Array S = {S1,S2,S3,...Sn} of size N corresponding to the number of match sticks in N matchboxes(0<=N<=1000} 2) F-Value (as explained above) 3) K-Value ( as explained above)  Output: 1 2 3 4 5 Here 3 is the number of matchsticks in matchbox I II III IV V minimum possible total number of matchsticks such that the conditioned explained in the problem statement is satisfied. Output -1 if it is not possible or invalid input.  For example, there are 5 match boxes i.e., N = 5 Let's say K is 3 (Rahul has to choose any 3 matchboxes)  Let's say F is 5(sum of matchsticks in 3 selected matchboxes should be multiple of 5). Rahul can choose II, III and V matchboxes which would give the total sum of 10 which is multiple of F i.e., 5. And 10 is the minimum possible matchsticks possible in the above case. So you have to answer the minimum possible matchstick(sum of the matchsticks in the selcted matchboxes) but the conditions given above should be satisfied.

Constraints:  0 < N <= 100000  0 <= Xi < i  i is counting from 1  Sample Input:  5  0  0  1  1  1  Sample Output:  1  2  3  3  3  Explanation:  Firstly the graph contains only node 0. The first line of output is 1 because the diameter becomes 1 when node 1 is added and connected to node 0. Diameter becomes 2 after adding node 2 to node 0. Then adding node 3, 4, 5, all of them are connecting to node 1, caculate the shortest path of all pairs of nodes, the maximum shortest path is 3, so the last 3 lines of output are all 3.

algorithm					The SHIELD is a secretive organization entrusted with the task of guarding the world against any disaster. Their arch nemesis is the organization called HYDRA. Unfortunately some members from HYDRA had infiltrated into the SHIELD camp. SHIELD needed to find out all these infiltrators to ensure  that it was not compromised.  Nick Fury, the executive director and the prime SHIELD member figured out that every one in SHIELD could send a SOS signal to every other SHIELD member he knew well. The HYDRA members could send bogus SOS messages  to others to confuse others, but they could never receive a SOS message from a SHIELD member. Every SHIELD member would receive a SOS message ateast one other SHIELD member, who in turn would have received from another SHIELD member and so on till NickFury. SHIELD had a sophisticated mechanism to  capture who sent a SOS signal to whom. Given this information, Nick needed someone to write a program that could look into this data and figure out all HYDRA members.  Sample Input Nick Fury : Tony Stark, Maria Hill, Norman Osborn Hulk : Tony Stark, HawkEye, Rogers Rogers : Thor,  Tony Stark: Pepper Potts, Nick Fury Agent 13 : Agent-X, Nick Fury, Hitler Thor: HawkEye, BlackWidow BlackWidow:Hawkeye Maria Hill : Hulk, Rogers, Nick Fury Agent-X : Agent 13, Rogers Norman Osborn: Tony Stark, Thor  Sample Output Agent 13, Agent-X, Hitler   You can code in any language of your choice.

algorithm					A polygon is a piecewise-linear, closed curve in the plane. That is, it is a curve ending on itself that is formed by a sequence of straight-line segments, called the sides of the polygon. A point joining two consecutive sides is called a vertex of the polygon. If the polygon is simple, as we shall generally assume, it does not cross itself. The set of points in the plane enclosed by a simple polygon forms the interior of the polygon, the set of points on the polygon itself forms its boundary, and the set of points surrounding the polygon forms its exterior. A simple polygon is convex if, given any two points on its boundary or in its interior, all points on the line segment drawn between them are contained in the polygons boundary or interior. Professor Amundsen proposes the following method to determine whether a sequence hp0, p1, . . . , pn1i of n points forms the consecutive vertices of a convex polygon. Output yes if the set {6 pi pi+1 pi+2 : i = 0, 1, . . . , n  1}, where sub script addition is performed modulo n, does not contain both left turns and right turns; otherwise, output no. Show that although this method runs in linear time, it does not always produce the correct answer. Modify the professors method so that it always produces the correct answer in linear time.

algorithm					Amazon wants to implement a new backup system, in which files are stored into data tapes. This new system must follow the following 2 rules:   1. Never place more than two files on the same tape.   2. Files cannot be split across multiple tapes.   It's guaranteed that all tapes have the same size and that they will always be able to store the largest file.   Every time this process is executed, we already know the size of each file, and the capacity of the tapes.

Each prisoner has a danger rank of his own and a group of friends (prisoners, who also have danger ranks). The guard has a list of prisoners with their corresponding danger ranks and he also has a list of the friends of each of the prisoners in the prison.  The danger rank is computed as follows: Prisoner 1 has a danger value of 5, his friends are Prisoner 2 and Prisoner 5, who have danger values of 3 and 4 respectively. So the danger value of Prisoner 1 is 5+3+4 = 12.  There could be any number of prisoners. Whichever prisoner has the highest value is the most dangerous(computed using the above method).

algorithm					The latest reality show has hit the TV: Cat vs. Dog. In this show, a bunch of cats and dogs compete for the very prestigious Best Pet Ever title. In each episode, the cats and dogs get to show themselves off, after which the viewers vote on which pets should stay and which should be forced to leave the show. Each viewer gets to cast a vote on two things: one pet which should be kept on the show, and one pet which should be thrown out. Also, based on the universal fact that everyone is either a cat lover (i.e. a dog hater) or a dog lover (i.e. a cat hater), it has been decided that each vote must name exactly one cat and exactly one dog. Ingenious as they are, the producers have decided to use an advancement procedure which guarantees that as many viewers as possible will continue watching the show: the pets that get to stay will be chosen so as to maximize the number of viewers who get both their opinions satisfied. Write a program to calculate this maximum number of viewers.   Input  On the first line one positive number: the number of testcases, at most 100. After that per testcase: One line with three integers c, d, v (1  c, d  100 and 0  v  500): the number of cats, dogs, and voters.  v lines with two pet identifiers each. The first is the pet that this voter wants to keep, the second is the pet that this voter wants to throw out. A pet identifier starts with one of the characters C or D, indicating whether the pet is a cat or dog, respectively. The remaining part of the identifier is an integer giving the number of the pet (between 1 and c for cats, and between 1 and d for dogs). So for instance, D42 indicates dog number 42.  Output  Per testcase: One line with the maximum possible number of satisfied voters for the show.  Sample Input 1  2  1 1 2  C1 D1  D1 C1  1 2 4  C1 D1  C1 D1  C1 D2  D2 C1   Sample Output 1  1  3

Examples: 1) Pattern : "abba", input: "redbluebluered" should return 1. 2) Pattern: "aaaa", input: "asdasdasdasd" should return 1. 3) Pattern: "aabb", input: "xyzabcxzyabc" should return 0.   I can think of a brute-force solution for this question where we add the character in the pattern and n length of the string to a hashmap and recurse over the pattern array and string. But is there anything more efficient? This was a pretty difficult question in my opinion.

algorithm					Implement algo for ls command in unix. You have n ordered file names with you. You have to print file names in column then in rows.   e.g. I have 5 files F1 F3 F5 F2 F4  Minimize on number of rows Maximize on number of columns  Max Page Width possible P Page width of any row = max width of all files in first column + max width of all files in second column + ... +max width of all files in last column

algorithm					You have a set of N objects. Each of these objects have certain properties associated with them. A property is represented by a (key, value) pair. For example, assume you have the following two objects. Tower: { 	(height, 100), (weight, 50), 	(xposition, 25), (yposition, 36) } Tree: { 	(area, 100), (noofleaves, 500), 	(height, 25), (yposition, 36) } Each object you have, will have at most 4 properties. An object will have at least 1 property. Note, from the two objects above, that it is not necessary for key in the properties to be same for all the objects. Also, it is not necessary for the key to be different. Now, given N such objects, you wish to answer M queries. Each query is represented by a set of properties (again, at most 4 properties, and at least 1 property). The answer for the query is the number of objects in the set, that have all the given properties. Two properties are considered equal iff both the key and the value match. For example, if you have the above two objects, then the answer for the following queries is Query: { (height, 100), (yposition, 36) } Answer: 1 // matches Tower, but not Tree Query: { (yposition, 36) } Answer: 2 // matches both Tower and Tree Query: { (height, 100), (noofleaves, 500) } Answer: 0 // neither Tower, not Tree satisfy both properties Input The first line of input contains N and M. This is followed by the description of the N objects. The description of the i-th object will start by a number k, which is the number of properties associated with the object. The next k lines contain two space separated strings - the property key and the property value. Note that the property value is not necessarily an integer (although this is so for the example above). This is followed by the description of M queries. The format of a query will be exactly same to that of the objects. Check the Sample Input for clarification. One test file will contain only one test case. A single test case may contain several queries. Output Print M lines. Each line must be the answer of the respective query. Constraints 1  N  10000  1  M  100000  1  k  4 Sample Input 2 3 4 height 100a weight 50b xposition 25a yposition 36b 4 area 100a noofleaves 500 height 25 yposition 36b 3 weight 80 xposition 25a yposition 36b 1 yposition 36b 2 xposition 25a yposition 36b Sample Output 0 2 1

algorithm					A seller sells lot of products in his store and people place orders,just like any other store. Each item has a different weight and price.  And each order can be a combination of different number of items with random quantity. Now each of these orders areto be put into different packages and sent to the courier company for delivery.  But there are certain rules while splitting items into packages, they are as below:  1. If the cost of all the items in an order is more than $1000, split those items into multiple packages, otherwise one package would be enough.  2. If the items in the same order are split into multiple packages, then the weight of the  packages should be equally distributed over the packages with consideration of optimum courier charges.  3. While splitting, NO PACKAGE can have a total price above $1000

algorithm					There is a string whose characters can only be either a, b or _ (there can be only one _ in the string). At each step, we can modify the string as follows: 1. _ can be swapped with its adjacent character, example a_ba can be changed to either _aba or ab_a. 2. Two characters adjacent to _ (both on the same side of _) can be reversed along with the _ if both characters are different, example, aa_ba can be changed to aaab_ but not to _aaba because both characters are a. You are given two strings, the initial state and the final state (lengths will be same), you have to output the minimum number of steps required to change the string in initial state to the string in the final state. example: input: a_b ab_ output: 1 input: abaa_a b_aaaa output: 4 reason for example 2:- abaa_a -> aba_aa -> ab_aaa -> _baaaa -> b_aaaa

algorithm					t's laundry day, and, as usual, you've been putting this off for quite some time. Also, unfortunately, you lacked the foresight to actually ensure all your dirty laundry stayed in your hamper whilst it accumulated (what? we can't ALL be underwear basketball pros!).  Begrudgingly, you've gathered up all the clothing you could find and sent them through the wash. Now you have a disheveled pile of clean, albiet disorganized, accoutrements. You come to the realization that you probably lost some items in the fray, so now it's time to fold and figure out what's gone missing!  To get a good idea of the state of your wardrobe, count up the number of distinct shirts, pants, and underwear you have as you go through the laundry. Also pair up your socks, noting the number of pairs of each kind of sock and if there are any lonely souls (single (and ready to mingle) socks).   Input Specifications  Each article of clothing will have its own separate line. You have a penchant for hoarding, so there is no guarantee as to the number of pieces, but you can assure yourself that each article can be easily categorized by description (name).  Articles of clothing will be fed in as line-delimited list. See below for examples.   Output Specifications  Output should be an alphabetically (case-insensitive) sorted, line-delimited list of the articles of clothing along with their count. Each field (count, category) should be separated by a pipe (|). If you come across a sock without a soulmate, the count should be designated by a 0 (zero). Socks that are in pairs should be on separate lines from the socks of the same category without pairs, and should come before the pairless sock. See below for examples.  Sample Input/Output  INPUT white shirt polka dot sock  red sock  superhero shirt  torn jeans  polka dot sock  white shirt  polka dot sock   OUTPUT 1|polka dot sock 0|polka dot sock 0|red sock 1|superhero shirt 1|torn jeans 2|white shirt  EXPLANATION As described above in the input and output specifications.

The {-1,5}{2,4} and {5,10} points can all be merged as they have intersecting points. They are merged to {-1,10}. The {20,35}{12,17} and {17,21} points can all be merged as they have intersecting points. They are merged to {12,35}

algorithm					Asked at Walmart Labs ---------------------------------- There is a row of seats. Assume that it contains 15 seats adjacent to each other. There is a group of people who are already seating in that row randomly. i.e. some are sitting together & some are scattered.  Take the row as a String in java.  The seat which is occupied is marked with a character 'X' & which is not occupied is marked with a dot '.'   Now your target is to make the whole group sit together i.e. next to each other and without having any vacant seat between them in such a way that the total number of hops or jumps at the end of the grouping them together should be minimum.  Ok let me try to explain you in details.  Here is the row having 15 seats represented by the String (0, 1, 2, 3, ......... , 14) -                 . . . . x . . x x . . . x . .   Now to make them sit together one of approaches is -   . . . . . . x x x x . . . . .    Following are the steps to achieve this -            1 - Move the person sitting at 4th index to 6th index -   Number of jumps by him =   (6 - 4) = 2            2 - Bring the person sitting at 12th index to 9th index - Number of jumps by him = (12 - 9) = 3           ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------           So now the total number of jumps made = ( 2 + 3) = 5 which is the minimum possible jumps to make them seat together.  There are also other ways to make them sit together but the number of jumps will exceed 5 & that will not be minimum.  For example bring them all towards the starting of the row i.e. start placing them from index 0. In that case the total number of jumps will be ( 4 + 6 + 6 + 9 ) = 25 which is very costly and not an optimized way to do this movement.  Now write an algorithm which will return the minimum number of jumps required to make them sit together.

Obviously, this can be solved by brute force with O(n^2) running time, or permute all possible pairs then eliminate those invalid pairs.

algorithm					You are driving a bus along a highway, full of rowdy, hyper, thirsty students and a soda fountain machine. Each minute that a student is on your bus, that student drinks one ounce of soda. Your goal is to drop the students off quickly, so that the total amount of soda consumed by all students is as small as possible.  You know how many students will get off of the bus at each exit. Your bus begins somewhere along the highway (probably not at either end) and move s at a constant speed of 37.4 miles per hour. You must drive the bus along the highway; however, you may drive forward to one exit then backward to an exit in the opposite direction, switching as often as you like. (You can stop the bus, drop off students, and turn around instantaneously.)  Describe an efficient algorithm to drop the students off so that they drink as little soda as possible.

data-structures					In a Formula-1 challenge, there are n teams numbered 1 to n. Each team has a car and a driver. Cars specification are as follows:   Top speed: (150 + 10 * i) km per hour  Acceleration: (2 * i) meter per second square.  Handling factor (hf) = 0.8  Nitro : Increases the speed to double or top speed, whichever is less. Can be used only once.  Here i is the team number. The cars line up for the race. The start line for (i + 1)th car is 200 * i meters behind the ith car.  All of them start at the same time and try to attain their top speed. A re-assessment of the positions is done every 2 seconds(So even if the car has crossed the finish line in between, youll get to know after 2 seconds). During this assessment, each driver checks if there is any car within 10 meters of his car, his speed reduces to: hf * (speed at that moment). Also, if the driver notices that he is the last one on the race, he uses nitro.  Taking the number of teams and length of track as the input, Calculate the final speeds and the corresponding completion times.

data-structures					We maintain stock prices of various companies. A stream of stock updates are coming in the form of ticker and value pair (example YHOO, 36.00). This value needs to be updated. We have a module of GUI that always displays top 5 stock prices at any given point of time. How would you maintain these values in memory?  My solution was to maintain a max-heap and a map that maps ticker to the corresponding node in the heap. At every update, we look-up the node and update the value, but also note if it is an increase or decrease in value. If increase, we do a sift-up, if decrease, we do a sift-down on the heap  for that node. For giving the top five values at any point of time, we don't want to disturb the order in the heap so we would copy the top five levels to a different memory and then perform 5 extract and heapifies on it.

data-structures					Suppose you are supplied with a file containing a list of words like ABC, BCD , CAB ( say each word in new line ). now you have to suggest algorithm for this problem - When a user type some character, we have to suggest him next character and basis of suggestion is that the character you are going to suggest should have maximum occurrence at that position among all these words.  For example , Let's say words are  ABC BCD CBA Now if user types 'A' we have to suggest  him 'B' as next character because if you see at second position in all words 'B' is occurring most number of times ( 2 times ). similarly if he types 'AB' then we need to suggest him third character as 'C' as in third index all words have same occurrence but 'C' comes first.

No two letters   may map to the same letter, but a letter may map to itself.    Example:    given "foo", "app"; returns true     we can map 'f' -> 'a' and 'o' -> 'p'    given "bar", "foo"; returns false    we can't map both 'a' and 'r' to 'o'     given "turtle", "tletur"; returns true   we can map 't' -> 't', 'u' -> 'l', 'r' -> 'e', 'l' -> 'u', 'e' -'r'      given "ab", "ca"; returns true       we can map 'a' -> 'c', 'b'

data-structures					Question 3 / 3 (Find first unique character) Find the first unique character in a Stream. Please note that you are being provided a stream as a source for these characters.  The stream is guaranteed to eventually terminate (i.e. return false from a call to the hasNext() method), though it could be very long. You will access this stream through the provided interface methods.  A call to hasNext() will return whether the stream contains any more characters to process. A call to getNext() will return the next character to be processed in the stream.  It is not possible to restart the stream.  If there is no unique character, then return the character '#'. # won't be any character in the character stream.  You just have to complete the function getUniqueCharacter() using the functions hasNext() and getNext() which are already defined.  Example:  Input:  aAbBABac  Output:  b  Input:  aBBa  Output:  #

data-structures					It was a pretty interesting question.  Assume that you are given a fixed set of floating point numbers. Now given a new floating point number 'x', the goal is to efficiently find the number that is closest to 'x' from the fixed set. Question is: what data structure will you actually use for storing the fixed set of floating point numbers to achieve this?  Edit: I missed to add. The interviewer further mentioned that I can not sort and that I can use any amount of time for creating the data structure (meaning this need not be efficient).  Since, I am not allowed to 'sort', I assumed that I can not use BST as I will have to compare numbers while populating the tree. But I didn't clarify it with him; I should have in hindsight.

data-structures					Once upon a time the following puzzle was suggested to pupils on a regional middle school olympiad on mathematics:     A set of coins consists of 15 coins: 14 coins are valid while a remaining 15-th coin is a false one. All valid coins have one and the same weight while the false coin has a different weight. One valid coin is marked. Is it possible to identify a false coin balancing coins 3 times at most? A jury member was a trainer of a team of undergraduates for programming contests. So a question on how to put the puzzle for programming arose naturally. Fin ally the problem was formulated as follows:     A set of coins consists of N coins: (N - 1) coins are valid while a remaining N-th coin is a false one. All valid coins have one and the same weight while the false coin has a different weight. One valid coin is marked. Write a program which for every input pair         a number N of coins under question,         a limit K of balancing  outputs either ``POSSIBLE" or ``IMPOSSIBLE" with respect to existence of a strategy to identify the false coin balancing coins K times at most.  Input   The first line of input contains a single integer T that represents a total amount of different pairs (N, K) to process.  Output  The output file should contain T lines with ``POSSIBLE" or ``IMPOSSIBLE" per line.

data-structures					Q: If you have all the companies that are traded, and live inputs are coming of which company is being traded and what is the volume, how do you maintain the data, so that you can carry out operation of giving the top 10 most traded companies by volume of shares most efficiently. A: I juggled between Hash Map and Max Heap. I said Max Heap, since I can take out top 10 companies in a jiffy with a Max Heap. But then he asked you will need to find a company everytime there is a trade, which will take quite some time in Heap. He pointed out that in real world scenario, number of trades happening, and hence searching of the company and updating it, will be many times more than finding top 10. Which bought me to HashMap. Updations can happen in Real time, while finding top 10 can be done in O(n) or O(nlog(n)) time. Even that wasn't optimal obviously. The interviewer was very nice and friendly type guy. He stressed that at every trade, at most, only 1 company will change in my top 10. This hit me and got me to the correct answer that we keep all actual data in HashMap, but also maintain a MinHeap of 10 most traded company.

data-structures					Find the(two) nodes which are at maximum distance in a binary tree? This is not finding the distance but the nodes which are farthest.

data-structures					In this problem, you have to implement a variation of Insertion Sort as described below. Suppose X is an array of N positive integers to be sorted. In this scheme, another array Y is used to store the sorted integers. This array is to be viewed as a circular array, ie. index (N-1)+1 = index 0 and index 0-1 = index N-1. The sorted integers get stored in a circular manner in Y, ie, it is possible that the index of the smallest integer may be greater than the index of the largest integer. Eg. 6 8 _ _ _ 1 2 4 5 is a view of the array Y sometime into the algorithm. _ indicates unused locations of the array. Smallest integer 1 is at index 5, largest integer 8 is at index 1. So the sorted array in Y is to be generated by printing the contents from index 5 to 1, assuming the array wraps around at the end, ie. after index 8, the next index is 0. Assume that h holds the index of the smallest integer in Y and t holds the index of the largest integer in Y. Initially,      1. h = t = 0      2. Y[0] = X[0] ie. the first integer in X[] is copied as the first integer in Y[].      3. All other elements in Y[] are initialised to a dummy value -1. The rest of the integers in X[] are now inserted one by one into Y[] such that Y[] always contains a sorted list of integers, with the smallest integer at index h and the largest at index t. This is done in the following manner: Let I be the next integer from X[] to be inserted into Y[]. Scan the array Y downwards from index h (with wrap-around at the end) till index t and find out the place in Y[] where I has to fit in. If I fits in at either end of the list, then insert it at the appropriate place in Y[]. Modify either t or h as appropriate to indicate the new array structure; ie. either t is incremented or h is decremented (with wrap-around). If I fits in somewhere in the middle of the list, then I should be inserted by shifting all the S smaller integers one place to the left or by shifting all the L larger integers one place to the right, depending on the number of integers to be shifted. That is, if S < L, the smaller integers should be shifted one place to the left and if S >= L, the larger integers should be shifted one place to the right. Again either h or t should be modified appropriately. Example Integers to be sorted X[]: 25 57 37 48 12 92 86 33 Contents of Y[] after inserting each integer from X[]:                                            Initially (t=0, h=0) 25 1 1 1 1 1 1 1                                            57 fits in at end (t=1) 25 57 1 1 1 1 1 1                                            37 fits in middle, S=1, L=1, so shift 57 right. (t=2) 25 37 57 1 1 1 1 1                                            48 fist in middle, S=2, L=1, So shift 57 right. (t=3) 25 37 48 57 1 1 1 1                                            12 fits in at beginning, circular property, (h=8, t=3) 25 37 48 57 1 1 1 12                                            92 fits in at end (t=4). 25 37 48 57 92 1 1 12                                            86 fits in middle, S=5, L=1, so shift 92 right, (t=5). 25 37 48 57 86 92 1 12                                            33 fits in middle, S=2, L=5, so shift 12, 25 left (h=7, t=5). 33 37 48 57 86 92 12 25 Input Specification The input will consist of a single line containing an integer N followed by the N integers to be sorted. All integers are positive and are separated by a single space. There will be no duplicates among the N integers. Output Specification The output should consist of N lines, each line containing N integers. The N integers are the contents of Y[] (ie. Y[0] to Y[N-1]) after the insertion of each integer from X[]. All integers on a line should be separated by a single space. N will be less than 50.

Any one of you who can solve it may appreciate and will get some benefits. In this problem, you have to implement a sorting algorithm called Tournament sort, which uses a complete binary tree. The depth D of the tree will be given as input. Also, N positive integers will be given, where N is the Dth power of 2 (ie, 2 ** D). Construct a complete binary tree of depth D and fill in the leaf nodes with the N given integers in the order given ie. the first integer should be at the leftmost leaf and the last integer should be at the rightmost leaf. Next, update all the non-leaf nodes in the tree such that each nonleaf node contains the maximum of the values in its children. Thus, the root will contain the maximum of all the N integers. Implement a procedure maxdelete which essentially removes the maximum value from the tree and updates the tree as follows:     1. traverse the tree from the root     2. find the leaf with the maximum value ie. the value at the root. (note that in this tree, if the value at a         non-leaf node is T, either its left child or its right child will have value T).     3. replace the value at that leaf node with -1 and     4. update the rest of the non-leaf nodes such that each non-leaf node contains the maximum of the         values in its children. Perform the maxdelete operation 3 times on the tree and print out the INORDER traversal of the tree after each operation. Example Given depth = 2 Given integers: 25 57 37 48 Constructed and updated tree:                    57                 /        \               57         48              /   \         /   \            25  57    37   48  after first 'maxdelete'                    48                 /        \               25         48              /   \         /   \            25  -1    37   48  after second 'maxdelete'                    37                 /        \               25         37              /   \         /   \            25  -1    37   -1  after third 'maxdelete'                    25                 /        \               25         -1              /   \         /   \            25  -1    -1   -1  Input Specification The input will consist of a positive integer D followed by a positive integer N (where N is the Dth power of 2) followed by N positive integers. All the integers are separated by a single space and will be on a single line. There will be no duplicates among the N integers. D will be greater than 1 and less than 9. Output Specification The output should consist of 3 lines. Each line should contain the INORDER traversal of the tree after a maxdelete operation. All the integers on a line should be separated by a single space. Sample Input/Output Input 2 4 25 57 37 48 Output 25 25 -1 48 37 48 48 25 25 -1 37 37 37 -1 25 25 -1 25 -1 -1 -1

data-structures					Consider a service counter. People waiting for service form a queue. At the start, the queue is empty and time is 0. The service time per person is 3 minutes. The input to the program consists of an integer N followed by a sequence of integers indicating the arrival time (in minutes) of the customers. These times are given as offset from the start of the simulation, so that an input of 44 means 44 minutes from the start of simulation. The sequence of input numbers is terminated by the number -1. Your program must simulate the queue and print out the following:     1. The number of customers waiting in the queue at time = N minutes from the start of simulation.     2. The arrival times of the customers in the queue at that time, in increasing order. Each integer must be separated by a space. Terminate your output with a newline character. For doing the computation, you can assume that if the counter is expected to be vacant at time t, the first person in the queue will be scheduled for service, before the counting is done for time t. You must use the queue data structure to solve this problem. Sample Input/Output Input 9 0 2 5 6 6 8 10 -1 Output 2 6 8   provide the solution using QUEUE. This problem will tell you your coding power.

data-structures					There is a monkey which can walk around on a planar grid. The monkey can move one space at a time left, right, up or down. That is, from (x, y) the monkey can go to (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), and (x, y-1). Points where the sum of the digits of the absolute value of the x coordinate plus the sum of the digits of the absolute value of the y coordinate are lesser than or equal to 19 are accessible to the monkey. For example, the point (59, 79) is inaccessible because 5 + 9 + 7 + 9 = 30, which is greater than 19. Another example: the point (-5, -7) is accessible because abs(-5) + abs(-7) = 5 + 7 = 12, which is less than 19. How many points can the monkey access if it starts at (0, 0), including (0, 0) itself? There is no input for this program. Print out the how many points can the monkey access.

So here is I have uptill now: for all permutations of possible paths:  find expected time for that shortest path  if (there is a path) and (expected time < min expected time)    minexpectedtime = expectedtime.  Can someone give me hints on pruning? I think I need a better way than going through all the permutations but am unable to think? Any help on algorithms/pruning/datastructure would be appreciated..

data-structures					Had my first and second phone interview with Amazon. I was dropped. This site has been a great help towards my preparation and most questions are based on what you find here. Posting my Questions is a small way of saying Thanks!  Interview 1: 1. What is polymorphism. 2. Design an OO parking lot. What classes and functions will it have. It should say, full, empty and also be able to find spot for Valet parking. The lot has 3 different types of parking: regular, handicapped and compact. 3. Coding: I have an integer array where every number appears even number of times and only one appears odd times. Find the number. (I said hashtable and he asked me to write code with Hashtable) 4. What data structure would you use to look up phone numbers for customer names. (I said Hashtable. Asked why hashtable, why not a tree. I said HT has O(1). Asked is order always 1, when more than O(1) in HT.   Second Interview: 1. Starter: Describe your college projects. 2. OO Design: Design a deck of cards. What classes, data structures will you use? How will you shuffle the cards? How will you divide (deck) among players. What class/function do you need to denote players and where will you add them? What class/function do you need to deck? What if I need to add 2 jokers to the deck of 52 cards.  3. Data Structures: How will you use a hashtable to find data in a tree. (Then he rephrased) suppose I have a hashtable, I want to store the data in a tree instead of a bucket. How will I do it. What complexity to find an element.  4. Bits & Bytes: Find if a binary representation of a number is palindrome. The function should work irrespective of number of bytes for an integer. Suppose if our machine is 4 bytes for an int, how will you use the program for 8 byte machine.  5. Unix: Suppose I have 100's of html files in many directories. I want to find the files having phone numbers.   b) Suppose I have 2 files having phone numbers, find the repeating phone numbers. (I said sort and grep). Then he asked what if the lines cannot be sorted.   All the best guys. I think the second interview was challenging since the interviewer was prodding until he heard a leave me alone. So it means that though they are based on questions in cc, be prepared for extensions. I think this site is all you need to prepare for Amazon interview.

coding					Cross the street ABC Company is involved in the logistics business.  The company has many outlets and stockyards in a city. The city is like an  N  M NM grid. We consider a single cell of the given grid to be a single block in the city. The stockyard is at the upper-left corner and the outlet is located in the lower right corner. Everyday, one of the employees has to travel from the upper left to the lower right corner for supplies. Each block in the city has a height, where the height of the block located at position (i,j) in the grid is equal to A [ i ] [ j ] A[i][j]. The company wants to change the heights of some of the blocks, so that the employee can enjoy a high-speed drive from the stockyard to the outlet. But this change comes at a certain cost.  Specifically, if they change a block height from x to y, then they must pay exactly  | x  y | |xy| dollars. Please help them find the minimum cost, such that by spending that specific amount, they can get a path from stockyard to the outlet with all blocks along the path having the same height.  In a single move, the employee can move from a block to any of its adjacent blocks. Note that during this journey, the employee is allowed to move in all four directions, fulfilling the condition that he never goes out of the grid at any point in time.  Input :  First line contains two positive integers N and M - number of rows and columns in the city. Then, N lines follow, each containing M integers, where the  j t h jth integer on the  i t h ith line denotes  A [ i ] [ j ] A[i][j].  Output :  The first and only line of output should contain minimum cost.  Constraints :  1<= N, M <=100  1<= height of blocks <=100  Sample Input 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 9 9 9 9 1 1 3 3 3 1 1 9 9 9 9 1 1 1 1 1 Sample Output 6 Explanation Optimal path taken by the employee will be : (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (1,5) -> (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (5,3) -> (5,4) -> (5,5) The height of each block along this path can be changed to  1 1, at a total cost of  6 6. There is no way to get a cost less than this.

coding					Programming Challenge Description:  Develop a service to help a client quickly find a manager who can resolve the conflict between two employees. When there is a conflict between two employees, the closest common manager should help resolve the conflict. The developers plan to test the service by providing an example reporting hierarchy to enable the identification of the closest common manager for two employees. Your goal is to develop an algorithm for IBM to efficiently perform this task. To keep things simple, they just use a single relationship "isManagerOf" between any two employees. For example, consider a reporting structure represented as a set of triples:  Tom isManagerOf Mary Mary isManagerOf Bob Mary isManagerOf Sam Bob isManagerOf John Sam isManagerOf Pete Sam isManagerOf Katie  The manager who should resolve the conflict between Bob and Mary is Tom(Mary's manager). The manager who should resolve the conflict between Pete and Katie is Sam(both employees' manager). The manager who should resolve the conflict between Bob and Pete is Mary(Bob's manager and Pete's manager's manager).   Assumptions: There will be at least one isManagerOf relationship. There can be a maximum of 15 team member to a single manager No cross management would exist i.e., a person can have only one manager There can be a maximum of 100 levels of manager relationships in the corporation  Input:  R1,R2,R3,R4...Rn,Person1,Person2 R1...Rn - A comma separated list of "isManagerOf" relationships. Each relationship being represented by an arrow "Manager->Person". Person1,Person2 - The name of the two employee that have conflict Output:  The name of the manager who can resolve the conflict Note: Please be prepared to provide a video follow-up response to describe your approach to this exercise.  Test 1: Test Input  Frank->Mary,Mary->Sam,Mary->Bob,Sam->Katie,Sam->Pete,Bob->John,Bob,Katie   Expected Output  Mary   Test 2: Test Input  Sam->Pete,Pete->Nancy,Sam->Katie,Mary->Bob,Frank->Mary,Mary->Sam,Bob->John,Sam,John  Expected Output  Mary

coding					There is a garden of strawberry plants represented by a 2D, square array.Each plant represents an element in the matrix ie it has a number of strawberries. If a plant doesnt have strawberries it is denoted by 0. If 0 is encountered you cannot travel through that path.    You can start from any cell along the left border of this ground (i.e the matrix) and travel until it finally stops at one cell in the right border, and you can only move to up/down/right. You can only visit each cell once. Calculate the maximum number of berries is obtained.  Backtracking using Dynamic programming is one of the methods i have thought of.  Also there some special conditions:  a.Even in the left border and right border, we can go up and down.  b. When we are at the top cell of one column, we can still go up, which demands us to   pay all current strawberries , then we will be teleported to the bottom cell of this column and vice   versa.  Input: user enters dimensions of ground ie size of matrix and the matrix itself  Output: is the maximum number of strawberries collected without encountering 0; in case we do we display 0.  Till now i have managed to find the largest value in the first column of the matrix but i am facing difficulty in testing the neighbours of that cell.  Also i am not able to store the position of the cell which i started from or even mark it.

coding					You are given a large array of 10,000,000 bits. Each bit is initially 0. You perform several operations of the type "Flip all the bits between start_index and end_index, inclusive". Given a sequence of several such operations, perform all the operations on the array. Finally, split the array into sets of 4 bits - first four, next four, then next four and so on. Each set can represent a hexadecimal integer. There will be exactly 2,500,000 hexadecimal integers. Calculate the frequency of each of the hexadecimal integers from '0' to 'f' among the 2,500,000 integers, and print it. See Input / Output and explanation of Sample Input / Output for clarity. Input  The first line of input contains an integer T (1  T  10), the number of test cases. Then follows the description of T test cases. You should assume that the array has exactly 10,000,000 bits and that the bits are all unset at the start of each test case. The first line of each test case contains an integer N (1  N  10,000), the number of operations performed. The next N lines contain two integers separated by a space, the start_index and end_index for the respective operation. Note that the flip operation is performed from start_index to end_index, inclusive. Also, the array is 1-indexed - meaning, the smallest index is 1 and the largest index is 10,000,000. Output  For each test case, output 16 integers on a single line, separated by single space characters. The first integer should represent the number of times 0 occurs among the 2,500,000 hexadecimal integers created according to the problem statement. The second integer should represent the number of times 1 occurs among the 2,500,000 hexadecimal integers created according to the problem statement, and so on. Constraints  1  start_index  end_index start_index  end_index  10,000,000 Sample Input  2 2 1 4 9999997 10000000 2 3 6 5 8  Sample Output  2499998 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2499998 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  Explanation  In the first test case, after we perform the two operations and split the array into 2,500,000 groups of 4 bits, the first and the last group will have all 4 bits set - representing 'f' hexadecimal digit. All the other groups will have all 4 bits unset - representing '0' hexadecimal digit. In the second test case, after we perform the two operations and split the array into 2,500,000 groups of 4 bits, the first two groups will have the state 0011. This represents the hexadecimal digit '3'. All the other groups will have all the 4 bits unset - representing '0' hexadecimal digit.

coding					You are given a rectangular grid with 2 rows and N columns. The top row is labeled 1 and the bottom row is labeled 2. The columns are labeled from 1 to N in increasing order. Each cell in the grid contains a single character. Consider a hamiltonian walk in this grid. Meaning, pick a starting cell, say (i,j), and consider a path that starts from (i,j) and goes through every cell in the grid exactly once. Note that you can only walk to adjacent cells, or cells that you share a common edge with. There may be several such paths. Let us concatenate the characters in the order in which the cells are visited during a walk. The string formed can be called the string for the walk. Among all the possible walks, and their respective strings, find out the lexicographically smallest string. We know that the length of the strings are all the same - to be precise, 2N. Thus, the lexicographically smallest string is simply the alphabetically smallest string if you compare the characters from left to right. Input  The first line of input contains a number T, the number of test cases. Then follow T test cases. Each test case contains 3 lines. The first line contains the number N, the number of columns in the grid. It is well known of course that the grid contains 2 rows. The next two lines contain the description of the grid in the form of two strings; the string of N characters in row 1 from left to right and the string of N characters in row 2 from left to right, respectively. Each character will be a lowercase engish letter. Output  Output a single line for each test case. The line must contain a string with 2N characters. This string should be the lexicographically smallest string for some hamiltonian walk in the grid. Constraints  1 = T = 100 1 = N = 10  Sample Input  2 3 abc def 10 ababaaabab bababababa  Sample Output  abcfed aaababababababababab  Explanation  In the first test the possible strings are { abcfed, adebcf, adefcb, badefc, bcfeda, cbadef, cfedab, cfebad, dabcfe, dabefc, defcba, edabcf, efcbad, fedabc, fcbade, fcbeda }. The smallest string is abcfed.

For example, for two dice, each with three sides, the results are:  (1, 1) -> 2 (1, 2) -> 3 (1, 3) -> 4 (2, 1) -> 3 (2, 2) -> 4 (2, 3) -> 5 (3, 1) -> 4 (3, 2) -> 5 (3, 3) -> 6  And the function should return:  2: 1 3: 2 4: 3 5: 2 6: 1

coding					Given a string (1-d array) , find if there is any sub-sequence that repeats itself. Here, sub-sequence can be a non-contiguous pattern, with the same relative order.  Eg:   1. abab <------yes, ab is repeated 2. abba <---- No, a and b follow different order  3. acbdaghfb <-------- yes there is a followed by b at two places 4. abcdacb <----- yes a followed by b twice  The above should be applicable to ANY TWO (or every two) characters in the string and optimum over time.  In the sense, it should be checked for every pair of characters in the string.

coding					Implement bool regex() Function.

coding					You are given a string S. Each character of S is either a, or b. You wish to reverse exactly one sub-string of S such that the new string is lexicographically smaller than all the other strings that you can get by reversing exactly one sub-string. For example, given abab, you may choose to reverse the substring ab that starts from index 2 (0-based). This gives you the string abba. But, if you choose the reverse the substring ba starting from index 1, you will get aabb. There is no way of getting a smaller string, hence reversing the substring in the range [1, 2] is optimal.  Input: First line contains a number T, the number of test cases. Each test case contains a single string S. The characters of the string will be from the set { a, b }.  Output: For each test case, print two numbers separated by comma; for example x,y (without the quotes and without any additional whitespace). x,y describe the starting index (0-based) and ending index respectively of the substring that must be reversed in order to acheive the smallest lexicographical string. If there are multiple possible answers, print the one with the smallest x. If there are still multiple answers possible, print the one with the smallest y.  Constraints: 1 ? T ? 100 1 ? length of S ? 1000  Sample Input: 5 abab abba bbaa aaaa babaabba  Sample Output: 1,2 1,3 0,3 0,0 0,4

coding					In Mathematics each number has one special number, which it supports, chosen as follows. It counts the number of ones in its own binary representation, and adds this count to itself to obtain the value of the number it supports. That is, if j(m) means the number of ones in the binary representation of m, then m supports m+j(m). For example, the number eight (1000 in binary) supports nine, whereas nine supports eleven. However, in this way not all the numbers get supported; some are left without support, and we call these numbers bleak. For example since one supports two, two supports three and three supports five, there is no number less than four, which would support four, so four is bleak.  Your task is for a given number recognize if it is bleak or supported by some number.

coding					give me the code for : Given a string say "I am a human being" the output should reverse all letters of each word but not the whole string as such. Eg: O/p should be "I ma a namuh gnieb"  I somewhat wrote the code, but i was asked what if there are extra spaces etc. (i am able to write the code sitting at my desktop at one short but there front of interviewer i am struggling. Need to build up my confidence) let me know the best and optimised way of writing this code. Also i suggest people to aviod using inbuilt functions as much as possible    My Answer is as below in perl

coding					Given an array say [0,1,2,3,5,6,7,11,12,14,20] given a number say 5. Now find the sum of elements which sum to 5 eg:2+3=5, 0+5=5 etc. I guess the interviewer wanted all possible combinations eg 0+2+3=5, etc

coding					Given 2 strings str1 and str2. What is the efficient way to navigate from str1 to str2? The constraints are i) a string can be changed to another string by changing only one character. ii) all the intermediate strings must be present in dictionary. If not possible, return not possible to navigate from str1 to str2. (pre-processing is allowed and enough memory is available). for example: str1 = feel and str2 = pelt, then the navigation is feel -> fell -> felt -> pelt

coding					In Amazon's interview, Round 2 they asked question:  Write a program to print inorder traversal of two trees.   Both values must be printed alternatively.  e.g. if inorder traversal of tree 1 is 10, 15, 20 and tree 2 is 100, 150, 200 then it should print 10, 100, 15, 150, 20, 200.  I tried printing it recursively by calling 2 functions recursively (f1 calls f2, then f2 calls f1 and so on).  I don't know where my approach is going wrong? I know there are other ways to do it as well but in this approach what is the mistake?

coding					Question 2 / 2 (Weighted Stone Arrangement) You are given an infinite number of stones.  The 1st stone has the weight 1 The 2nd stone has the weight 3 The tth stone has the weight W(t) = 2 * W(t-1) + W(t-2) Thus, the weights of the first 10 stones are  1, 3, 7, 17, 41, 99, 239, 577, 1393, 3363  Note that you only have one stone of each weight.  You have a weighing machine which is the age old 2-pan balance. You wish to use this machine to measure the weight of an item whose weight is T. The item will always be kept on the right pan. A stone may be kept on either one of the pans. Also, it is not required to use all the stones.  The stones have a weird magnetic property, due to which, the kth stone cannot be in the same pan as the (k-1)th stone. This means that the stone with weight 239 cannot be in the same pan as the stone with weight 99, or in the same pan as the stone with weight 577; and so on.  For example,  T = 11 can be measured as  LEFT PAN: 1, 17 RIGHT PAN: 7 Note that the other alternative  LEFT PAN: 1, 3, 7 RIGHT PAN: is Illegal since 3 cannot be in the same pan as 1 (or 7 cannot be in the same pan as 3).  T = 21 can be measured as  LEFT PAN: 41 RIGHT PAN: 3, 17 It can be proven that to measure any weight T, there exists a unique arrangement of stones that satisfy the given constraints and measure weight T. Thus, T = 11 or T = 21 can only be measured by the respective arrangements above.  You are given T in the input. Output the arrangement of stones that measures T.  Input Specification  The input contains a single positive integer T.  Output Specification  Output the weights of the stones used on the left pan in increasing order, one number per line. Then output a blank line. Followed by the weights of the stones used on the right pan in increasing order. Note that it is assumed that the item will be kept on the right pan.  If there is no stone kept on the right pan, simply output the weights of the stones used on the left pan in increasing order as above, followed by a blank line.  Constraints  1  T  1015  Sample Input 1  11 Sample Output 1  1 17  7 Sample Input 2  21 Sample Output 2  41  3 17 Sample Input 3  1000 Sample Output 3  3 41 239 1393  99 577

coding					Directi Off Campus Interview Process 2013-14 ....................................................................... This is year 4096 and humans have found a medicine for immortality in the year 2048. Tukro a famous online social networking site founded in the year 3072 was celebrating its 1024th anniversary. To celebrate the occasion its CEO, Shark, and his team had launched a unique personalised video of length 17min 4sec for each user. The video consisted of a collage of all popular posts made by the user on Tukro.  Raka shared this video with all his friends without reviewing it. Immediately after he finished watching the 1024 second length clip he realised that he made a huge mistake. The video was made of all posts made by Raka, irrespective of the privacy settings of the individual post.  A post is compromised if a friend who was not supposed to see the original post, has seen it now. Raka wants to know how many of his posts have been compromised. Tukro provides the list of users who have watched the video till now. Help Raka find how many posts were compromised.  Raka has N friends, identified by a unique integer between 0 and N-1.  Raka has L lists of friends, identified by a unique integer between 0 and L-1.  Each list can be of length at the most N. One friend cannot be added more than once to the same list. A list must have at least one friend. A friend may be added to multiple lists. Visibility of a post in Tukro works through two filters  Include Filter: An array of lists, from the L lists above. Friends can view a post if they belong to any friend list, specified in the Include Filter. Exclude Filter: An array of lists, from the L lists above. Friends can view a post if their name does not belong to any friend list, specified in the Exclude Filter. Some caveats of the above are  If no Filter is active, the post is visible to all friends If only Include Filter is active, a friend can see the post only if he is present in at least one of the lists of Include Filter. If only Exclude Filter is active, a friend can see the post only if he is not present in any of the lists of exclude filter. If both Include and Exclude Filters are active, a friend can see the post if and only if he is present in at least one of the lists of include filter and he is not present in any of the lists of exclude filter if he is present in both an include filter list, and exclude filter list, he should not be able to see the post Input Specification  First line contains a single integer N, the number of friends.  Second line contains a list of integers separated by a single space. The first integer V, represents the number of friends who viewed the video. There are V other integers in the line representing the ID's of friends who viewed the video.  Third line contains a single integer L representing the number of lists.  L lines follow. Each line representing a list. The first integer of the line A, denotes the size of the list; followed by A integers, each denoting the friends in the list.  Next line contains a single integer P denoting the number of posts in the video. 2 * P lines follow. Each pair denoting the Include Filter and Exclude Filters of one post respectively.  First two lines denote the Include and Exclude Filters for first post Next two lines denote the Include and Exclude Filters of second post and so on..  An include filter is represented by a list of space separated integers. The first integer B represents the number of lists in the filter. B may be 0, to denote that the include filter is not active. If B is more than 0, the include filter is active and the next B integers in the line denote the ID's of lists present in the include filter.  Exclude filters are also represented in the same format.  Output Specification  Print a single integer specifying the number of posts that are compromised according to the definition above.  Constraints  1  N  10000 1  V  N 1  L  6 1  P  100000  Note that the constraints on N and P are large. Your solution will exceed time limits if its complexity is O(N*P). Even O(V*P) solutions may exceed time limit! Note the small constraint on L. Sample Input 1  10 8 1 2 5 6 0 9 8 7 4 2 4 3 2 7 6 3 0 1 5 3 2 8 9 4 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 3 1 2 3 0  Sample Output 1 1  Explanation  There are 10 friends. Their ID's are from 0 to 9 8 of them viewed the video = {0,1,2,5,6,7,8,9} There are 4 lists List-0 has 2 friends {3,4} List-1 has 1 friend {7,6} List-2 has 3 friends {0,1,5} List-3 has 3 friends {2,8,9} There are 4 posts Post-0 doesn't have any include filter but has List-0 - {3,4} - in exclude filter 3, or 4, have not seen the video Hence Post-0 is not compromised Post-1 has an include filter of List-1 - {7,6} - and no exclude filter. But other friends have seen the video Hence Post-1 is compromised Post-2 doesn't have any filters. Such a post was intended to be seen by anyone. Hence Post-2 is not compromised. Post-3 has a include filter of List-1, List-2 and List-3. Their union is {0,1,2,5,6,7,8,9} These are the exact friends who saw the video Hence Post-3 is not compromised Hence only 1 post is compromised. Sample Input 2 5 2 2 3 5 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 4 3 2 3 4 1 0 3 1 2 3 0 3 0 1 3 0 3 2 3 4 1 0  Sample Output 2 1

Solution should be as space and time efficient as possible. Your service is only responsible for maintaining and updating the state of the board between two players, given their sequence of moves.

coding					Q: Do you know what is a Binary tree? How would you go about coding for addition of a new element to Binary tree? A: I asked if they want a Binary Tree or a BST? When he said BST I just said we can have a recursive function in which we pass the root of the tree and see if the value to be added is smaller or bigger than the root, and depending on result, we go to left or right of the tree, assuming the left (or right) is not null. If null, just use new to create a memory location, put the value, and use the left reference of the root to link to this new memory.	Simple basic stuff.

coding					I Got this Crazy Question on PHONE INTERVIEW AT GOOGLE:  Design and implement a class to generate random numbers in an arbitrary probability distribution given by an array of integer weights, i.e. for int[] w return a number, n, from 0 to w.length - 1 with probability w[n] / sum(w). Using an existing random number generator with a uniform distribution is permitted.  Example distribution: w = 1, 2, 3, 2, 1  Example probabilities: w / sum = 1/9, 2/9, 1/3, 2/9, 1/9  Example results: n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4  Documentation:  Class java.util.Random  public int nextInt(int n)  Returns a pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value between 0 (inclusive) and the specified value (exclusive), drawn from this random number generator's sequence. The general contract of nextInt is that one int value in the specified range is pseudorandomly generated and returned. All n possible int values are produced with (approximately) equal probability.  Parameters: n - the bound on the random number to be returned. Must be positive. Returns: the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value between 0 (inclusive) and n (exclusive) from this random number generator's sequence Throws: IllegalArgumentException - if n is not positive

coding					Each time a visitor requests a page from our website, our webserver writes a log entry recoding the visitor's identity and the kind of page requested.  Entries are written in chronological order to a plain-text file, with one entry per line.  The format of each entry is:   user-id      page-type-id    User IDs are arbitrary strings that uniquely represent a given user; if a user visits multiple pages, each log entry will have the same user ID.  Page type IDs are arbitrary strings that uniquely represent a given kind of page on our site, such as the homepage, a product detail pages, or the shopping cart. Tons of users visit our website, but there are only a few dozen types of pages.  We can use our weblogs to answer questions about user behavior.  One interesting question is: what is the most common three page sequence through the site?  E.g., if the most common pattern is to buy items advertised on the home page of the site, we might see the most common three page sequence as "Homepage -> ProductDetailPage -> ShoppingCart".  However, if customers spend a lot of time browsing the "Customers who bought this item also bought" feature, we might see the most common three page sequence as "ProductDetailPage -> ProductDetailPage -> ProductDetailPage".  Attached is a sample log file for your reference.  Within the first 10 lines of the sample, customer "234" travels through the sequences "Listmania -> ProductDetail -> Checkout" and "ProductDetail -> Checkout -> HomePage" once each.  For the sake of this test feel free to assume that everything will fit in memory.  Do keep in mind that given the size of our data sets, performance has to be considered, also, we will be looking at more than just correct output..

coding					A specification for a very simple file system stored inside a flat file (FS). There is an associated index file (FI) which provides meta-data to the data inside the flat file (FS).   FS:- FS cannot be larger than 1 MB. The entire space in FS is divided into blocks of 128 bytes.  FI:- FI provides meta-data regarding what is stored in FS. Directories, sub-directories and files are supported. Files can be binary or text which is marked in the meta-data. The following is a detailed description of FI-   FI consists of a sequence of entries or records. Each record (R) is 48 bytes long. Each record has an index and is referred by its index. There can be a max 8192 Records if each file is exactly one block long. Therefore FI can be at most 8192 x 48 = ~384KB in size. The structure of each R is -  1             2  3  4    5  |-----------------|--|--|---|-------|  1  Name (32 bytes) 2  Attribs (2 bytes) Described below 3  Directory Entry (2 bytes) - what is the parent directory of this record 4  Size (4 bytes)  File size, 0 for Directory 5  Blocks list (8 bytes)  Name  The file/dir name can be at most 32 bytes long. Only ascii alpha-numeric characters are allowed. The only symbols allowed are - $ and . A string shorter than 32 characters is terminated with an ascii value of 0. Attributes  Only the relevant attributes are described here             1st bit  if set is a File else Dir             3rd bit  if set is a Text file else Binary Dir Entry The index of the parents Record in FI. The root entry has this value as 0. Size - The actual size of the file (not the block count), always 0 for directories Blocks list - Lists which blocks in FS holds the contents of this record. 8 bytes allows for 4 block indices to be specified each of size 2 bytes. If a file is larger than 4 block sizes (i.e. larger than 512 bytes) then a chaining mechanism is used where the last 2 bytes of the block from FS is used to point to the next block in FS.  Suppose if the file is of 8 block size, then the last 2 bytes of 4th block will point to 5th block and last 2 bytes of 5th block points to 6th block and so on. Directories will not have any block entries.  The root directory always occupies R[0].  Problem A] Write a class com.progress.test.FSReader which has a static read method and takes as its only argument a file path similar to \files\abc.txt and returns a String of its contents. If the path provided is not a file or not a text file null must be returned. No exceptions must be thrown. Signature -> String com.ma.test.FSReader.read(String path)  For test purposes, you can use file path \ma\ProblemStatement.txt which returns present file contents.

coding					Had my first and second phone interview with Amazon. I was dropped. This site has been a great help towards my preparation and most questions are based on what you find here. Posting my Questions is a small way of saying Thanks!  Interview 1: 1. What is polymorphism. 2. Design an OO parking lot. What classes and functions will it have. It should say, full, empty and also be able to find spot for Valet parking. The lot has 3 different types of parking: regular, handicapped and compact. 3. Coding: I have an integer array where every number appears even number of times and only one appears odd times. Find the number. (I said hashtable and he asked me to write code with Hashtable) 4. What data structure would you use to look up phone numbers for customer names. (I said Hashtable. Asked why hashtable, why not a tree. I said HT has O(1). Asked is order always 1, when more than O(1) in HT.   Second Interview: 1. Starter: Describe your college projects. 2. OO Design: Design a deck of cards. What classes, data structures will you use? How will you shuffle the cards? How will you divide (deck) among players. What class/function do you need to denote players and where will you add them? What class/function do you need to deck? What if I need to add 2 jokers to the deck of 52 cards.  3. Data Structures: How will you use a hashtable to find data in a tree. (Then he rephrased) suppose I have a hashtable, I want to store the data in a tree instead of a bucket. How will I do it. What complexity to find an element.  4. Bits & Bytes: Find if a binary representation of a number is palindrome. The function should work irrespective of number of bytes for an integer. Suppose if our machine is 4 bytes for an int, how will you use the program for 8 byte machine.  5. Unix: Suppose I have 100's of html files in many directories. I want to find the files having phone numbers.   b) Suppose I have 2 files having phone numbers, find the repeating phone numbers. (I said sort and grep). Then he asked what if the lines cannot be sorted.   All the best guys. I think the second interview was challenging since the interviewer was prodding until he heard a leave me alone. So it means that though they are based on questions in cc, be prepared for extensions. I think this site is all you need to prepare for Amazon interview.

coding					Background:For any perimeter of a rectangle, there may be multiple different dimensions that result in that specificperimeter. When there are multiple dimensions for the same perimeter, there may also be multiple areas. In other words, any one perimeter can result in different areas depending on the possible combinations of dimensions that can make that perimeter.Definition:A dimension or instance of dimensions for a rectangle is a pair of length and width values. A dimension with length 5 and width 4 is considered the same as a dimension with length 4 and width 5. The area of a rectangle is the length multiplied by the width. The perimeter of a rectangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of all 4 sides or the sum of 2 multiplied by the width and 2 multiplied by the length.Requirement:A finite set of possible perimeters of a rectangle exist given a maximum perimeter, minimum length of any side, and the constraint that all sides are whole numbers; we will call this set U. Find the subset of perimeters in set U where all of the possible dimensions for a perimeter in the subset have areas common with the areas of one or more other perimeters in set U. Your program should take the minimum length of any side and the maximum perimeter, respectively, as command line arguments and output a comma separated list of the perimeters that meet the criteria explained above, sorted from lowest to highest. The program should be submitted in a single Java class with an implemented main function that provides the correct output given the two input arguments.Example:javac YourClass.javajava YourClass 1 6410,14,18,20,22,26,30,34Please make sure your program can be run with the exact syntax above. You can name the class anything you like, but the class name will be passed to a program that will compile it and then run a set of tests on the resulting program. It is important that your class will compile and run from within a local directory, not a package directory.

It should have a member variable, last_buffer, which is a copy of the internal unsigned char array from the last change to the buffer. For example, if the buffer has "0123456" and undo_buffer[3] = 'z' is called, then the Undo_Buffer class holds the new change value of "012z456". Undo_Buffer should provide a method undo() which will revert the buffer to the last saved buffer. There does not need to be any access to the last_buffer, except to provide the functionality of undo.

object-oriented-design					Write a simple Zoo simulator which contains 3 different types of animal:  monkey, giraffe and elephant.  The zoo should open with 5 of each type of animal. 	Each animal has a health value held as a percentage (100% is completely healthy).  Every animal starts at 100% health.  This value should be a floating point value. 	The application should act as a simulator, with time passing at the rate of 1 hour with each interation.  Every hour that passes, a random value between 0 and 20 is to be generated for each animal.  This value should be passed to the appropriate animal, whose health is then reduced by that percentage of their current health. 	The user must be able to feed the animals in the zoo.  When this happens, the zoo should generate three random values between 10 and 25; one for each type of animal.  The health of the respective animals is to be increased by the specified percentage of their current health.  Health should be capped at 100%. 	When an Elephant has a health below 70% it cannot walk.   If its health does not return above 70% once the subsequent hour has elapsed, it is pronounced dead. 	When a Monkey has a health below 30%, or a Giraffe below 50%, it is pronounced dead straight away.  	The user interface should show the current status of each Animal and contain two buttons, one to provoke an hour of time to pass and another to feed the zoo.   The UI should update to reflect each change in state, and the current time at the zoo.

object-oriented-design					The interviewer explained me the real world scenario of the blockbuster..  A location receives hundreds of copies of each film. They can be of multiple formats ( DVD,CD,Blu ray). We need to store the following information regarding the film: director, actress, rating. There are different genres possible. Action, drama etc. All the copies of a movie are placed under its shelf marked with its corresponding genre. All the movies of same genre are of the same cost. But the first time the movie arrives it stays as a different genre called "New RElease" and it is placed in a different location and priced differently. It stays that way for x number of days and after that it goes back to its corresponding genre.Each customer can take out any number of movies at a time. We need to store the due date for all those movies.  Design a software with class diagrams for this. This was asked in the  first round telephonic interview.

object-oriented-design					Had my first and second phone interview with Amazon. I was dropped. This site has been a great help towards my preparation and most questions are based on what you find here. Posting my Questions is a small way of saying Thanks!  Interview 1: 1. What is polymorphism. 2. Design an OO parking lot. What classes and functions will it have. It should say, full, empty and also be able to find spot for Valet parking. The lot has 3 different types of parking: regular, handicapped and compact. 3. Coding: I have an integer array where every number appears even number of times and only one appears odd times. Find the number. (I said hashtable and he asked me to write code with Hashtable) 4. What data structure would you use to look up phone numbers for customer names. (I said Hashtable. Asked why hashtable, why not a tree. I said HT has O(1). Asked is order always 1, when more than O(1) in HT.   Second Interview: 1. Starter: Describe your college projects. 2. OO Design: Design a deck of cards. What classes, data structures will you use? How will you shuffle the cards? How will you divide (deck) among players. What class/function do you need to denote players and where will you add them? What class/function do you need to deck? What if I need to add 2 jokers to the deck of 52 cards.  3. Data Structures: How will you use a hashtable to find data in a tree. (Then he rephrased) suppose I have a hashtable, I want to store the data in a tree instead of a bucket. How will I do it. What complexity to find an element.  4. Bits & Bytes: Find if a binary representation of a number is palindrome. The function should work irrespective of number of bytes for an integer. Suppose if our machine is 4 bytes for an int, how will you use the program for 8 byte machine.  5. Unix: Suppose I have 100's of html files in many directories. I want to find the files having phone numbers.   b) Suppose I have 2 files having phone numbers, find the repeating phone numbers. (I said sort and grep). Then he asked what if the lines cannot be sorted.   All the best guys. I think the second interview was challenging since the interviewer was prodding until he heard a leave me alone. So it means that though they are based on questions in cc, be prepared for extensions. I think this site is all you need to prepare for Amazon interview.

c-plus-plus					Stanford has to select a team of dodgeball players from its class of 2013. There are n students in the class and each student is identified by his/her student ID, which is between 1 and n. The coach has to select K players out of these n students for his team. But there is a twist, if among the K dodgeball players, a player's ID number evenly divides another player's ID number, then there is a high chance of them getting into a fight. The coach will do his best to select the K players so that no pair of players among them will want to fight one another. But if the game turns out to be very popular, this becomes impossible. Complete the function dodgeBall to return the minimum size of K at which it becomes impossible to choose a  dodgeball team that has no fighting?  Input Format: One line of text, containing the size of the class of 2013, n  Constraints: 1 <= n <= 5,000,000,000 n is guaranteed to be an even number  Output Format: The minimum size of K that guarantees the existence of 2 players who fight with each other in any K-sized subset of the class.  Sample Input: 4  Sample Output: 3  Explanation: If the team = {1,2,3}: 1&2 or 1&3 can fight with each other If the team = {1,3,4}: 1&3 or 1&4 can fight with each other If the team = {2,3,4}: 2&4 can fight with each other If K=2, then the teams {3,4} or {2,3} will have no fights. So 3 is the smallest value of K for which any K-sized team, must include a fighting pair.  Sample Input: 2  Sample Output: 2  Explanation: The team = {1,2}: 1&2 can fight with each other

c-plus-plus					A flipping rule is given as a follows: Consider a series of positive integer.  Take three numbers in the series next to each other. On applying the flipping rule to these numbers, the right most number will go to the left most number position and the other two numbers will move one position to the right at the same time. The rule can be applied to any three numbers present next to each in the series and can be applied as many times as needed. Given n as the number of element in the original series, elements of the original series and a target series of a numbers, figures out if the target series can be created by flipping numbers of the original number and output the word POSSIBLE followed by the number of times the flipping rule has to be applied. In case, the target series cannot be formed, output the word IMPOSSIBLE.

c-plus-plus					There is a garden of strawberry plants represented by a 2D, square array.Each plant represents an element in the matrix ie it has a number of strawberries. If a plant doesnt have strawberries it is denoted by 0. If 0 is encountered you cannot travel through that path.    You can start from any cell along the left border of this ground (i.e the matrix) and travel until it finally stops at one cell in the right border, and you can only move to up/down/right. You can only visit each cell once. Calculate the maximum number of berries is obtained.  Backtracking using Dynamic programming is one of the methods i have thought of.  Also there some special conditions:  a.Even in the left border and right border, we can go up and down.  b. When we are at the top cell of one column, we can still go up, which demands us to   pay all current strawberries , then we will be teleported to the bottom cell of this column and vice   versa.  Input: user enters dimensions of ground ie size of matrix and the matrix itself  Output: is the maximum number of strawberries collected without encountering 0; in case we do we display 0.

c-plus-plus					Skynet Skynet has grown to become the dominant force on earth and has almost completely wiped out the human race. Skynet has been building robots ever since it's inception and has been updating it's models every year while making them better. Skynet wants to annihilate humanity completely. It plans to remove one last band of humans lead by John Connor. Skynet thinks it can destroy these humans using only two of it's robots. But Skynet doesn't want to send two robots with the same model number lest John Connor finds out a weakness in that model and easily destroy both of them. Skynet has at its disposal N robots and to save space Skynet has stored information about pairs of robots belonging to the same model. If it doesn't have any info stored for a particular robot then it is implied that the robot is the only one in that model. Given these constraints, in how many ways can Skynet pick two robots to destroy John Connor and his rag tag group of humans. Inputs N Total number of robots. Each robot is assigned a number from 0 to N1 (2 <= N <= 100000) P Number of pairs for which Skynet has information (2 <= P <= 100000) This is followed by P pairs. Each pair has two numbers P and P each where 0<=P <=N1 and 0<=P <=N1 and P != P Output Number of ways in which Skynet can select 2 robots such that both the robots are different models. Example Input: 4 2 0 1 2 3 Example Output: 4 Explanation: Here robots 0 and 1 are of one model, say model A. And 2 and 3 are of another model, say B. Therefore the total number of possibilities of picking 2 robots such that no two robots are of the same model are ( 0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2) and (1, 4) = 4

c-plus-plus					GLaDOS is feeling bored, so she decided to come up with a board game. The game is as follows. There is board of dimension n x n (2 <= n <= 10). Each position in this board is either a 0 or a power of 2, between 2 and 2048. Once the board is set up, there are only two moves allowed - move all left or move all right. The way move all left works is as follows: For every row on the board, starting from the rightmost position each element is moved to its left. An element with a zero value does not move. An element with non-zero value can move to its left if the value of the element to its left is a 0 or has the same value as the current element. In case, the element to the left is 0 then the element and 0 swap positions i.e., 4 0 0 4 would become 4 0 4 0 In case, the element to the left has the same value as the current element then the left element combines with its right element and creates an element with double the value in place of the right element and leaves a 0 in its current place. For e.g., 2 2 would become 4 0 or 2 2 2 2 would become 4 0 4 0. The combining operation can cause a cascading operation i.e., if the new element created has the same value as the element to its left, it can combine again. For e.g., if a row had 8 4 2 2, move left would combine 2 and 2 to form 4 leading to 8 4 4 0. Now, it is possible to combine further as the element to the left of 4 has the same value, thus after the second combine, the row would be 8 8 0 0. And again 8 and 8 would form a 16. Thus the final values in the row would be 16 0 0 0. But if the row was 8 4 2 0 2, then moving left would result in 8 4 2 2 0. The cascading operation is allowed only after a combination operation, There would no cascading operation if the element is swapped with 0. Similar rules apply for move all right, wherein for every row elements starting from the leftmost position move to their right. You can either choose move all left or move all right operation but not both. Now given a state of the board, you have determine what will be the maximum value on the board after either move all left or move all right. Example 3 2 2 0 2 2 4 2 0 2 Move all left would result in: 4 0 0 4 0 4 2 2 0 The maximum value on the board after this move is 4. Move all right would result in: 0 4 0 0 0 8 0 2 2 In the first row, 2 and 2 combines to form 4. In the second row, left most 2 combines with 2 to form 4. As the element to its right has a value 4, combination operation cascades to form 8. The maximum value on the board after this move is 8. Now of the two operations, the higher of the two maximum values is 8. Thus the expected output is 8. Input 3 2 2 0 2 2 4 2 0 2 Output 8 Input 3 0 0 4 0 2 2 0 4 8 Output 8 Time limit per test case: 1 second(s)

c-plus-plus					I was given 90 minutes to complete this test. I didn't understand how the sample test cases arrived at their return output.  Can anyone explain?   ================ Approximate Matching (Coding)  You are given 3 strings: text, pre_text and post_text. Let L be a substring of text. For each substring L of text, we define pattern_score as follows: * pre_text_pattern_score = highest n, such that first n characters of L are equal to the last n characters of pre_text and occur in the same exact order. * post_text_pattern_score = highest n such that last n characters of L are equal to the first n characters of post_text and occur in the same exact order. * pattern_score = pre_text_pattern_score + post_text_pattern_score For example, if L = "nothing", pre_text = "bruno", and post_text = "ingenious", then  * pre_text_pattern_score of L is 2 because the substring "no" is matched, and * post_text_pattern_score is 3 because the substring "ing" is matched. * pattern_score is 5 = 2 + 3 Your program should find a non-empty substring of text that maximizes pattern_score. *  If there is a tie, return the substring with the maximal pre_text_pattern_score. *  If multiple answers still have a tied score, return the answer that comes first lexicographically. Complete the definition of function string calculateScore(string text, string prefix,string suffix) Constraints: * text, pre_text, and post_text contain only lowercase letters ('a' - 'z') * 1 <= |text| <= 50 * 1 <= |pre-text| <= 50 * 1 <= |post-text| <= 50 (where |S| denotes the number of characters in string S) *  It is guaranteed that an answer will always exist; i.e. there will always be a substring in text that matches either at least one character at the end of pre-text or at least one character at the beginning of post-text.  Sample case #1 text: "nothing" prefix: "bruno" suffix: "ingenious" Returns: "nothing"  Sample case #2 text: "ab" prefix: "b" suffix: "a" Returns: "b"

Unfortunately some members from HYDRA had infiltrated into the SHIELD camp. SHIELD needed to find out all these infiltrators to ensure  that it was not compromised.  Nick Fury, the executive director and the prime SHIELD member figured out that every one in SHIELD could send a SOS signal to every other SHIELD member he knew well. The HYDRA members could send bogus SOS messages  to others to confuse others, but they could never receive a SOS message from a SHIELD member. Every SHIELD member would receive a SOS message ateast one other SHIELD member, who in turn would have received from another SHIELD member and so on till NickFury. SHIELD had a sophisticated mechanism to  capture who sent a SOS signal to whom. Given this information, Nick needed someone to write a program that could look into this data and figure out all HYDRA members.

An orienteering map is to be given in the following format.  ########  #@....G#  ##.##@##  #..@..S#  #@.....#  ######## In this problem, an orienteering map is to be given. Calculate the minimum distance from the start to the goal with passing all the checkpoints. Specification * A map consists of 5 characters as following.  You can assume that the map does not contain any invalid characters and  the map has exactly one start symbol 'S' and exactly one goal symbol 'G'.   * 'S' means the orienteering start.  * 'G' means the orienteering goal.  * '@' means an orienteering checkpoint.  * '.' means an opened-block that players can pass.  * '#' means a closed-block that players cannot pass. * It is allowed to move only by one step vertically or horizontally (up, down, left, or right) to the  next block.  Other types of movements, such as moving diagonally (left up, right up, left down and right down) and skipping one or more blocks, are NOT permitted. * You MUST NOT get out of the map. * Distance is to be defined as the number of movements to the different blocks. * You CAN pass opened-blocks, checkpoints, the start, and the goal more than once if necessary. * You can assume that parameters satisfy following conditions.   * 1 <= width <= 100  * 1 <= height <= 100  * The maximum number of checkpoints is 18.  * Return -1 if given arguments do not satisfy specifications, or players cannot arrive at the goal  from the start by passing all the checkpoints. 1/6 Examination 1 *You can choose Java or C++

c-plus-plus					Question 3 / 3 (Find first unique character) Find the first unique character in a Stream. Please note that you are being provided a stream as a source for these characters.  The stream is guaranteed to eventually terminate (i.e. return false from a call to the hasNext() method), though it could be very long. You will access this stream through the provided interface methods.  A call to hasNext() will return whether the stream contains any more characters to process. A call to getNext() will return the next character to be processed in the stream.  It is not possible to restart the stream.  If there is no unique character, then return the character '#'. # won't be any character in the character stream.  You just have to complete the function getUniqueCharacter() using the functions hasNext() and getNext() which are already defined.  Example:  Input:  aAbBABac  Output:  b  Input:  aBBa  Output:  #

c-plus-plus					There is a monkey which can walk around on a planar grid. The monkey can move one space at a time left, right, up or down. That is, from (x, y) the monkey can go to (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), and (x, y-1). Points where the sum of the digits of the absolute value of the x coordinate plus the sum of the digits of the absolute value of the y coordinate are lesser than or equal to 19 are accessible to the monkey. For example, the point (59, 79) is inaccessible because 5 + 9 + 7 + 9 = 30, which is greater than 19. Another example: the point (-5, -7) is accessible because abs(-5) + abs(-7) = 5 + 7 = 12, which is less than 19. How many points can the monkey access if it starts at (0, 0), including (0, 0) itself? There is no input for this program. Print out the how many points can the monkey access.

In the second one, the C++ library only contains pointers and normal function calls, nothing C++ related. I didn't really know what he was looking for in the second case but then he gave me function overloading as a hint. Then mentioned name mangling. 2. You have an empty class. What does compiler do? 3. What if the class had 1 object? Then he asked if these objects can be sorted? (Sorry, I don't get it either.) When I said you can't sort 1 object then he switched and said an array of objects. 4. Can you sort these objects in the class as a key to a map? 5. What's the sorting order of a map? 6. You have a singly linked list from 1 to 10. and your pointer is pointing to the 5th element.

If a class A has member function func1().. there is only one copy of it ...for all the objects... then why do we have separate copy of virtual pointer for each object...while value is same in all the objects ?   How do you think compiler finds the address of a member function for a non polymorphic class?   Don't you think the same mechanism could have been used to find out the virtual pointer for that class also?

c-plus-plus						Code should be in C or C++ and should be production quality. I.e. has to check for errors at runtime, and cannot overflow or underflow buffers or corrupt memory. 	Pls include a paragraph explaining how you would test this: 	Implement a routine that processes packets from the network over a reliable TCP connection:  HRESULT ProcessData(PBYTE pDataBuffer, IN ULONG cbBufferSize)// you need to implement this routine  Information:  typedef struct tag_HEADER {     ULONG cbTotalPacketLen;            ULONG cbThisChunkLen; #define FLAG_FIRST_CHUNK_IN_PACKET   1 #define FLAG_LAST_CHUNK_IN_PACKET    2    ULONG flags; } CHUNK_HEADER;  The format the server sends will be a sequence of PACKETs. Each packet is broken up into a sequence of one or more CHUNKs. Each Chunk starts with a CHUNK_HEADER. The first CHUNK in a packet has flags field set to FLAG_FIRST_CHUNK_IN_PACKET. The last chunk that has flags FLAG_LAST_CHUNK_IN_PACKET sets. Chunks in the middle of packet will have neither flag set. A chunk can be any size up to 16384 bytes. A packet can be any size unbounded.  The total length of the packet will be cbTotalPacketLen, each chunk in the packet will have this same length set in the chunk header. The length of the current chunk will be always cbThisChunkLen.  The ProcessData(...) routine will be called many times, with whatever data has arrived from the network. The network is reliable so data will arrive in sequence it was sent. However as this is a TCP stream, not a message there is no guarantee that the call to ProcessData will correspond to a complete chunk. I  That is important point, ProcessData may be called many times for even one CHUNK. And may be called with an arbitrary number of bytes each time ranging from just one byte.  Your goal: with ProcessData() is to implement a routine that reads the stream and the CHUNKs and from that reconstructs a _complete_ Packet (i.e. has data from all chunks in the packet). Once a packet is constructed you should pass it to a routine:  HRESULT ProcessPacket(PBYTE pPacketBytes, IN ULONG cbCompletePacketSize); //you do not need to implement this. Just call it EVERY time you have a completed packet.

c					Binu is an aspiring pattern-artist. He spends his free time creating patterns using the computer keyboard. One day, he was creating a random pattern using /and \ characters and during the process, realized that his pattern contained open paths and enclosures (see figure alongside). In this figure, Binu has drawn 6 characters (using either / or \) each in 4 rows on a standard graph paper. He counted two enclosures (marked with dots), the larger one of 16 squares size and the smaller one of 4 squares size. He also noticed several open paths (non-closed spaces) which are not relevant in the context of this problem. Your task is to help Binu by writing a program that counts all the enclosures in a given pattern and find the size of the largest enclosure. For simplicity, we will not dwell into cases where there are enclosures within enclosures (your code doesnt need to consider such cases).  You may note in the figure that each / or \ is equivalent to 2 units in the graph. Input:- The input file would contain multiple independent test cases, each test case being a pattern, drawn by Binu. Each test case begins with two integers a and b (1 <= a <= 50, 1 <= b <= 50) where a and b represents the length and breadth of the pattern. The next b lines contain a characters each which are either / or \ (no whitespaces in between).  The input ends with a test case having a and b as 0. In the above figure, a = 6, b = 4. Output:- For each test case, your code needs to output (on a separate line) two integers x and y (separated by a single whitespace) where x is the total number of enclosures in that pattern and y is the size of the biggest enclosure. In the above figure, the output would be 2 16; meaning, there are 2 enclosures & the size of the largest enclosure is 16 squares. If there are no enclosures in a pattern, you need to output 0 0.  If two or more enclosures have the same size (and that happens to be the maximum size), you need to output that size.  EX I/P:  6 4 \//\\/ \///\/ //\\/\ \/\/// 3 3 /// \// \\\ 0 0  EX O/P  2 16 0 0  Note:  /\ \/ will have 4 diamond shape squares in it. They have given a image. not able to add it here.

c					How can we avoid a stack overflow ?  The problem is like this. Lets say I have a method A() invoked from main(). Now A() invokes B(), B() inturn invokes C() ... keep going...  so the current process stack will have limited capacity to accomodate all the activation frames that are being created dynamically when each new method is invoked.  so if this continues, at one point of time, stack will exhaust. so whats the method to handle this.  The very simple example can be: void main (){  main(); return 0; }  if you run this, we can see the error as run time error for stack overflow. in such scenario whats the optimal way to deal with it?

c					Yesterday, I had an interview. There they asked me when the code optimization happens? Say,  int abc;//Global variable abc = 3; if(abc == 3) {   printf("abc will be always 3"); } else {   printf("This will never executed"); } Now the question is when the optimization happens? A... At Run time B... At compile time. I answered at compile time... To me I thought, compiler checks for volatile keyword at compile time. If the variable is not declared as volatile then it optimizes the code. But, when the compiler comes to know that, this variable is never ever going to be other than 3? If it is at run-time, then when compiler comes to know that variable is never ever going to be other than 3? Because if the variable is going to be changed after this part of the code executed. Please clear my doubt

c					"Simple Parallel Crypto"  We need a utility that will perform a simple XOR crypto transform.  They key will be given as a set of bytes in an external file and the number of bytes in the key will dictate the "chunk size".   The plain text data will be given on stdin and the utility must break it into chunk-size sections and XOR it against the key and write the cypher text it to stdout.  After each chunk is processed the key is rotated left by one bit to make a new key.  This means that the key will repeat every N chunks, where N is the number of bits in the key.  The plain text may not be a multiple of the chunk size in length.  The plain text may also be very large, far exceeding the available memory+swap space in the system.  In addition to just performing the algorithm, the utility needs to scale so that multiple chunks of plain text can be efficiently processed in parallel on multi-core/multi-CPU machines.   As such, a number of threads must be created to process chunks of data concurrently.  Regardless of the number of threads, the output cypher text must remain the same.  Any errors/status must come out on stderr.  Required Command Line Options: 	-k <filename>       Specify the key file   	-n #                Number of threads to create  Example:    The keyfile contains two bytes:     0xF0 0xF0    The plain text file has the bytes:  0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 0x11 0x12 0x13 0x14     encrypt -k keyfile -n 1 < plain > cypher     The cypher text has the bytes:      0xF1 0xF2 0xE2 0xE5 0xD2 0xD1 0x94 0x93   Implementation Details/Notes:  The utility can be written in C/C++.    If C/C++, it should build and run on a POSIX system (like Linux or Mac OS X).  A good way to generate keyfiles and plain text files is as follows:  dd if=/dev/urandom of=plain bs=4096 count=4096 dd if=/dev/random of=keyfile bs=4096 count=1

c					The Chef has one long loaf of bread. Let us say, of length 1. He wants to cut it into as many little loaves as he can. But he wants to adhere to the following rule: At any moment, the length of the longest loaf which he possesses may not be larger than the length of shortest one, times some constant factor. Every time, he is only allowed to cut exactly one loaf into two shorter ones. Input  One floating-point number, 1 k 1.999, meaning the stated constant factor. Output  First, you should output one number n, the maximal achievable number of loaves for the given value of the constant factor. Then, you should output any proof that this number of loaves is in fact achievable: n-1 descriptions of cutting, using the following notation. At each step, you print two numbers: first, the index of the loaf that you want to cut into two parts; second, the length of the newly created loaf (cut off from the original one). It is assumed that the starting loaf has index 0. Each newly created loaf will be given the lowest possible free integer index (so, at the ith step this will be i). Each time, the size of size of the original loaf will be decreased by the size of the newly created loaf. Example  Input: 1.5 Output: 4 0 0.4 0 0.3 1 0.2

c					Onsite Interview (coding test) -- Q3) Now write a derived class Undo_Buffer that derives from Buffer. It will provide the ability to undo the last change to the buffer. It should have a member variable, last_buffer, which is a copy of the internal unsigned char array from the last change to the buffer. For example, if the buffer has "0123456" and undo_buffer[3] = 'z' is called, then the Undo_Buffer class holds the new change value of "012z456". Undo_Buffer should provide a method undo() which will revert the buffer to the last saved buffer. There does not need to be any access to the last_buffer, except to provide the functionality of undo.

arrays					You are given a string S consisting of N brackets, opening "("  and/or closing ")". The goal is to split S into two parts (left and  right), such that the number of opening brackets in the left part is  equal to the number of closing brackets in the right part. For example, given S = "(())", the function should return 2,  because:  the first two characters of S, "((", contain two  opening brackets, and  the remaining two characters of S, "))", contain  two closing brackets.  In other example, given S = "(())))(", the function should return  4, because:  the first four characters of S, "(())", contain two  opening brackets, and  the remaining three characters of S, "))(", contain  two closing brackets.  In other example, given S = "))", the function should return 2,  because:  the first two characters of S, "))", contain zero  opening brackets, and  there are no remaining characters, so they contain  also zero closing brackets.

arrays					In a Formula-1 challenge, there are n teams numbered 1 to n. Each team has a car and a driver. Cars specification are as follows:   Top speed: (150 + 10 * i) km per hour  Acceleration: (2 * i) meter per second square.  Handling factor (hf) = 0.8  Nitro : Increases the speed to double or top speed, whichever is less. Can be used only once.  Here i is the team number. The cars line up for the race. The start line for (i + 1)th car is 200 * i meters behind the ith car.  All of them start at the same time and try to attain their top speed. A re-assessment of the positions is done every 2 seconds(So even if the car has crossed the finish line in between, youll get to know after 2 seconds). During this assessment, each driver checks if there is any car within 10 meters of his car, his speed reduces to: hf * (speed at that moment). Also, if the driver notices that he is the last one on the race, he uses nitro.  Taking the number of teams and length of track as the input, Calculate the final speeds and the corresponding completion times.

There are n types of gears, Agear type of i has a radius Rj and cost Cj. The two gears specified, i and j , must have Ri+Rj >= D, inorder for there to be a way of placing them so that they touch and work togeather. The objective is  to find the pair which costs the least.  You need to produce a design table that gives the most suitable match for every gear type in the list. For every gear type 'i', you need to consider its description (Ri,Ci) and list the gear type 'j' to pair with 'i' in table position T[i]. The best map might be the same type(Ti=i). if there are multiple solutions with the same cost,  choose the gear with the largest radius.If both the cost and radius you need are found in more than one gear type, choose the type with the smallest index j. If no radius can be found that allow the distance D to be covered, table should contain 0.  Input   n D  R1 R2 ... Rn  C1 C2 ... Cn  Output  T1 T2 ... Tn

arrays					I have an array containing duplicates in the following format: arr[]={ 2,9,1,5,1,4,9,7,2,1,4 }   I want to sort the array in place such that all the duplicate elements are moved towards the end and sorted in different sub arrays like following: arr[]={ 1,2,4,5,7,9, 1,2,4,9, 1 }   There is no range for integers for the array specified. Following is the code which i tried. This code recursively sorts the subarrays and then move duplicates towards the end. But Complexity wise this is not optimal solution. Please suggest if it can be solve in O(n) or O(nlogn). Entire code is as follows:

arrays					Given an array, return true, if it can be partitioned into two subarrays whose sum of elements are same, else return false                                                                                               Example: Input: {5,1,5,11} Output: true        (as it can be divided into {5,1,5} {11} where 5+1+5=11)

arrays					Given a list of integers, find out the biggest interval that has all its members in the given list. e.g. given list 1, 7, 4, 6, 3, 10, 2 then answer would be [1, 4]. Develop algorithm and write code for this

arrays					Given an array of numbers, arrange it such that all the numbers less than a given key should come before the key and all the numbers greater than the key should come after it. For example: arr = { 0, -1, -2, 2, 0, 3, 5}, given key = 0  answer should be {-1, -2, 0, 0, 2, 3, 5} Order of elements that are smaller or greater than key does not matter i.e. sorting is not expected. So, {-1,-2, 0, 0, 5, 2, 3} is also a correct answer.  Time complexity should not be more than O(n).

arrays					In an array of unsorted integers (you may assume the array may contain +ve, -ve and 0s), write a function  int returnNthMax(int[] arr, int n)  which will return the nth Max number.

arrays					You are given an unsorted integer array of size N. This array contains integer from range 0 - N (not necessarily distinct and same integer can appear multiple time in an array). You need to find pair of all the elements in array which sum up to N.  First i gave a solution using an extra array of size N to keep count of each integer in original array and was able to give solution in O(n) Time complexity and O(n) space complexity.  Then interviewer asked me to decrease space complexity, for which i gave solution as sorting the given array (in nlogn time) and then find the pairs in O(n) time, and hence total time complexity was O(nlogn) and space complexity as O(1).  But interviewer kept pressing for a better time complexity (than O(nlogn)) with O(1) space complexity.  How is it possible, i could not think of any way.

arrays					Given two arrays, A and B, both containing integers, find values that appear in both arrays and output them.   I knew the fastest answer to this, which is basically adding array A to a hashmap and then checking if that map contains each element of B, which is an O(n) operation, but uses memory in O(n) as well. The interviewer then asked if I could figure a way of doing this with a complexity of O(n) without using any extra memory, basically just O(1) for memory.   Is this possible? I could not think of a simple quick solution for this on the fly, but I imagine it is possible.  Here is the code I wrote during the interview.

arrays					A sequence of numbers is called a zig-zag sequence if the differences  between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and  negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive  or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a  zig-zag sequence.   For example, 1,7,4,9,2,5 is a zig-zag sequence because the differences  (6,-3,5,-7,3) are alternately positive and negative. In contrast,  1,4,7,2,5 and 1,7,4,5,5 are not zig-zag sequences, the first because  its first two differences are positive and the second because its last  difference is zero.    Given a sequence of integers, sequence, return the length of the  longest subsequence of sequence that is a zig-zag sequence. A  subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (possibly  zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in  their original order

java					Create a RESTful microservice that implements a card shuffling algorithm, as defined below.  Should have evidence of test-driven development with unit tests. Use best practices of interfaces and generics for abstraction, preferably implementing a strategy pattern for deploy-time dependency injection of a shuffling algorithm. Requirements:          Create a microservice that stores and shuffles card decks.          A card may be represented as a simple string such as 5-heart, or K-spade.          A deck is an ordered list of 52 standard playing cards.          Expose a RESTful interface that allows a user to:          PUT an idempotent request for the creation of a new named deck.  New decks are created in some initial sorted order.          POST a request to shuffle an existing named deck.          GET a list of the current decks persisted in the service.          GET a named deck in its current sorted/shuffled order.          DELETE a named deck.          Design your own data and API structure(s) for the deck.          Persist the decks in-memory only, but stub the persistence layer such that it can be later upgraded to a durable datastore.          Implement a simple shuffling algorithm that simply randomizes the deck in-place.          Implement a more complex algorithm that simulates hand-shuffling, i.e. splitting the deck in half and interleaving the two halves, repeating the process multiple times.          Allow switching the algorithms at deploy-time only via configuration.

java					Programming Challenge Description:  Develop a service to help a client quickly find a manager who can resolve the conflict between two employees. When there is a conflict between two employees, the closest common manager should help resolve the conflict. The developers plan to test the service by providing an example reporting hierarchy to enable the identification of the closest common manager for two employees. Your goal is to develop an algorithm for IBM to efficiently perform this task. To keep things simple, they just use a single relationship "isManagerOf" between any two employees. For example, consider a reporting structure represented as a set of triples:  Tom isManagerOf Mary Mary isManagerOf Bob Mary isManagerOf Sam Bob isManagerOf John Sam isManagerOf Pete Sam isManagerOf Katie  The manager who should resolve the conflict between Bob and Mary is Tom(Mary's manager). The manager who should resolve the conflict between Pete and Katie is Sam(both employees' manager). The manager who should resolve the conflict between Bob and Pete is Mary(Bob's manager and Pete's manager's manager).   Assumptions: There will be at least one isManagerOf relationship. There can be a maximum of 15 team member to a single manager No cross management would exist i.e., a person can have only one manager There can be a maximum of 100 levels of manager relationships in the corporation  Input:  R1,R2,R3,R4...Rn,Person1,Person2 R1...Rn - A comma separated list of "isManagerOf" relationships. Each relationship being represented by an arrow "Manager->Person". Person1,Person2 - The name of the two employee that have conflict Output:  The name of the manager who can resolve the conflict Note: Please be prepared to provide a video follow-up response to describe your approach to this exercise.  Test 1: Test Input  Frank->Mary,Mary->Sam,Mary->Bob,Sam->Katie,Sam->Pete,Bob->John,Bob,Katie   Expected Output  Mary   Test 2: Test Input  Sam->Pete,Pete->Nancy,Sam->Katie,Mary->Bob,Frank->Mary,Mary->Sam,Bob->John,Sam,John  Expected Output  Mary

java					You will be given a sequence of passages, and must filter out any passage whose text (sequence of whitespace-delimited words) is wholly contained as a sub-passage of one or more of the other passages.  When comparing for containment, certain rules must be followed:  The case of alphabetic characters should be ignored  Leading and trailing whitespace should be ignored  Any other block of contiguous whitespace should be treated as a single space  non-alphanumeric character should be ignored, white space should be retained  Duplicates must also be filtered - if two passages are considered equal with respect to the comparison rules listed above, only the shortest should be retained. If they are also the same length, the earlier one in the input sequence should be kept. The retained passages should be output in their original form (identical to the input passage), and in the same order.  Input: For each test case a single line comprising the passages (strings) to be processed, delimited by | characters. The | characters are not considered part of any passage.  Output: A single line of filtered passages in the same |-delimited format.  Input1: IBM cognitive computing|IBM "cognitive" computing is a revolution| ibm cognitive computing|'IBM Cognitive Computing' is a revolution?

java					Jack love playing games, Gluttonous snake( an old game in Nokia era) is one of his favorite. However, after playing gluttonous snake so many times, he finally got bored with the game, so he changed the rules:  Rule 1: Write a code to find the Max sum path in a grid (2-D array), with dimension with n rows and m column (1<=n,m<=500)  Rule 2: In the 2D Array, each cell (elements) contains a value v in the array is from (-1<=v<=99999)  Rule 3. You can start from any position of the leftest column (border) of the array to the rightest(border) column of the array to calculate the Max Sum path.  Rule 4. You can move up, right, down, and CAN'T move left, and can visit each element only one time.  Rule 5.If the element is -1, it means the path is blocked, and you can't go through the path (calculate it in the sum), you have to choose other path to calculate the sum.   For example, if a 4*4 array grid {{-1,3,2,1}                {2,-1,2,4}                {2,2,-1,3}                {4,2,1,2}}; The max sum path is : (from grid[4][0]) 4-->up-->2-->left-->2-->down-->2-->left--> 1-->left-->2-->up-->3-->up-->4-->up-->1  and the sum is 4+2+2+2+1+2+3+4+1 =21  Thank you  Here is my code, I am new in Java and there is still lots of improvements import java.util.*; public class MainClass {  public static void main(String[] args) {  @SuppressWarnings("resource") Scanner rowDimension = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print("Enter the number of rows: "); int firstInput = rowDimension.nextInt();  @SuppressWarnings("resource") Scanner columnDimension = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print("Enter the number of columns: "); int secondInput = columnDimension.nextInt();  //Input two number to generate 2D Array Integer [][] array = new Integer[firstInput][secondInput];  //The purpose of the array is check the wall (cell value = -1) boolean [][] visited = new boolean[firstInput][secondInput];  //Use Math.random() to generate the cell of the array int[][] randomTable = new int[firstInput][secondInput]; for (int row = 0; row < firstInput; row++) { for (int column = 0; column < secondInput; column++) { // multiply by 1000000 to get a number between 0 and 99999 randomTable[row][column] = (int)(Math.random() * 1000000 -1); System.out.print(randomTable[row][column] + " "); } System.out.println(); }  //Start form the left-down location of grid int i = firstInput-1, j = 0; visited[i][j] = true; double sum = array[i][j]; while(true) { int max = -1; int maxi = 0, maxj = 0;  //Case1 : choose path: UP if(i-1 >= 0 && i-1<= firstInput-1 && j>=0 && j<= secondInput-1 && array[i-1][j] != null && array[i-1][j]>max && !visited[i-1][j]) { max = array[i-1][j]; maxi = i-1; maxj = j; }  //Case2 : choose path: Down if(i+1 >= 0 && i+1<= firstInput-1 && j>=0 && j<= secondInput-1 &&array[i+1][j] != null && array[i+1][j]>max && !visited[i+1][j]) { max = array[i+1][j]; maxi = i+1; maxj = j; }  //Case3 : choose path: Right if(i >= 0 && i<= firstInput-1 && j+1>=0 && j+1<= secondInput-1 && array[i][j+1] != null && array[i][j+1]>max && !visited[i][j+1]) { max = array[i][j+1]; maxi = i; maxj = j+1; }  i = maxi; j = maxj; visited[i][j] = true; sum += max;  //To the destination : Right-Up location of the grid if(i == 0 && j == secondInput-1) break; } System.out.println(sum);  } }

(you are not required to implement the string parsing logic since this could take too long)  Hint: give an example of a tree data structure.

java					Test Question

java					Problem Two: Conference Track Management  You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble fitting them into the time constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities! So you write a program to do it for you.   The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.  Each session contains multiple talks.  Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish by 12 noon, for lunch.  Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.  The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.  No talk title has numbers in it.  All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).  Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.  Note that depending on how you choose to complete this problem, your solution may give a different ordering or combination of talks into tracks. This is acceptable; you dont need to exactly duplicate the sample output given here.

The interviewer thought that storing a[iter]='x' (dup) and a[iter]=<index> was a better solution to avoid running a second pass over the string. In my mind, I disagreed using the array index, one can find the character that appears only once. The interviewer persisted, and told me to think about it.

java					In a Formula-1 challenge, there are n teams numbered 1 to n. Each team has a car and a driver. Cars specification are as follows:   Top speed: (150 + 10 * i) km per hour  Acceleration: (2 * i) meter per second square.  Handling factor (hf) = 0.8  Nitro : Increases the speed to double or top speed, whichever is less. Can be used only once.  Here i is the team number. The cars line up for the race. The start line for (i + 1)th car is 200 * i meters behind the ith car.  All of them start at the same time and try to attain their top speed. A re-assessment of the positions is done every 2 seconds(So even if the car has crossed the finish line in between, youll get to know after 2 seconds). During this assessment, each driver checks if there is any car within 10 meters of his car, his speed reduces to: hf * (speed at that moment). Also, if the driver notices that he is the last one on the race, he uses nitro.  Taking the number of teams and length of track as the input, Calculate the final speeds and the corresponding completion times.

Unfortunately some members from HYDRA had infiltrated into the SHIELD camp. SHIELD needed to find out all these infiltrators to ensure  that it was not compromised.  Nick Fury, the executive director and the prime SHIELD member figured out that every one in SHIELD could send a SOS signal to every other SHIELD member he knew well. The HYDRA members could send bogus SOS messages  to others to confuse others, but they could never receive a SOS message from a SHIELD member. Every SHIELD member would receive a SOS message ateast one other SHIELD member, who in turn would have received from another SHIELD member and so on till NickFury. SHIELD had a sophisticated mechanism to  capture who sent a SOS signal to whom. Given this information, Nick needed someone to write a program that could look into this data and figure out all HYDRA members.  Sample Input Nick Fury : Tony Stark, Maria Hill, Norman Osborn Hulk : Tony Stark, HawkEye, Rogers Rogers : Thor,  Tony Stark: Pepper Potts, Nick Fury Agent 13 : Agent-X, Nick Fury, Hitler Thor: HawkEye, BlackWidow BlackWidow:Hawkeye Maria Hill : Hulk, Rogers, Nick Fury Agent-X : Agent 13, Rogers Norman Osborn: Tony Stark, Thor  Sample Output Agent 13, Agent-X, Hitler   You can code in any language of your choice.

java					Judgement Day  Skynet has figured out a way to take over the world. It will keep producing robots and molecular assemblers until it has converted all matter for its own purpose. Robots work to produce more robots and molecular assemblers. Molecular assemblers convert matter into programmable matter to be used to produce more robots and molecular assemblers.  Initial Info On day 0, Skynet started with 3 robots, 1 molecular assembler and 0 units of programmable matter.  On day i (i>0), robots produced can be calculated as the sum of the robots produced on the previous day and thrice the units of programmable matter produced on the previous day.  On day i, number of molecular assemblers produced can be calculated as the sum of robots produced on the previous day and twice the units of programmable matter produced on the previous day.  On day i, the units of programmable matter produced can be calculated as five times the number of molecular assemblers produced on the previous day.  How many robots, molecular assemblers and units of programmable matter will be produced on the Judgement Day (day n)?  Input/Output Specifications  Input format: Two integers x and y (1<=x,y<=10^6) such that the judgement day falls on day n = x*y.  Output format: Since the number of robots, molecular assemblers and units of programmable matter grows very rapidly, we want you to output them modulo 1000000007.  The output should be a string having the following format: R#M#P, where - R is the number of robots produced on judgement day modulo 1000000007 - M is the number of molecular assemblers produced on judgement day modulo 1000000007 - P is the number of units of programmable matter produced on judgement day modulo 1000000007

java					In synchronous request from browser how do you get results if you have to access 2 different databases

java					In assembly line situation, how do you pass a job from thread1 to thread2 to thread3?

java					in a web request you want to send results to the browser/client only if the caching operation goes success. how do you accomplish this.

java					public class Gen {        public static void main(String[] args) {            Integer i1 = new Integer(1);          Integer i2 = new Integer(1);              System.out.println(i1 != i2);          System.out.println(i1 <= i2);          System.out.println(i1 >= i2);          }  }

java					A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. The leader of this array is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of A. Write a function: int arrLeader(int A[], int N); int arrLeader(NSMutableArray *A); int arrLeader(const vector<int> &A); class Solution { int arrLeader(int[] A); } class Solution { public int arrLeader(int[] A); } function arrLeader(A); function arrLeader(A) function arrLeader($A); function arrLeader(A : array of longint; N : longint) : longint; def arrLeader(A) sub arrLeader { my (@A)=@_; ... } def arrLeader(a) Private Function arrLeader ( A As Integer() ) as Integer that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the leader of array A. The function should return -1 if array A does not contain a leader. Assume that: l         N is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000]; l         each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..2,147,483,647]. For example, given array A consisting of ten elements such that: A[0] = 4  A[1] = 2  A[2] = 2  A[3] = 3  A[4] = 2  A[5] = 4  A[6] = 2  A[7] = 2  A[8] = 6  A[9] = 4 the function should return -1, because the value that occurs most frequently in the array, 2, occurs 5 times, and 5 is not more than half of 10. Given array A consisting of five elements such that: A[0] = 100  A[1] = 1  A[2] = 1  A[3] =  50  A[4] = 1 the function should return 1. Complexity: l         expected worst-case time complexity is O(N); l         expected worst-case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments). Elements of input arrays can be modified. // you can also use includes for example: // #include <algorithm> int arrLeader ( const vector<int> &A ) {     // write your code here  }

These eight lines constitute three  rectangles.   Conditons :   1. The rectangles will always enclose some 0s. e.g. last two vertical lines does not constitute a  rectangle.   2.  A rectangle can contain multiple rectangles    Output : should be no. of rectangles formed in the matrix(intersecting rectangles are also counted).

java					Unable to get what exactly the Question Is?  so What is the whole logic behind this question .It seems to be  complete Math problem to me.  There is a Grasshopper in a tropical forest. The grasshopper can jump only vertically and horizontally, and the length of jump is always equal to x centimeter. A GRasshopper has found herself at the center of some cell of the chess board of the size pxq centimeters(each cell is 1x1 centimeters). She can jump as she wishes for an arbitrary number of times, she can even visit a cell more than once. the only restriction is that she cannot jump out of the board. The grasshopper can count the number of cells that she can reach from the starting position(x,y). Let's denote this amount by dx,y. your task is to find the number of such starting position(x,y), which have the maximum possible value of dx,y Input The integer array contains three integers p,q,x  p= length of the board q= width of the board x=length of the grasshoppers jump.  Output Output the only integer - the number of the required starting position of the Grasshopper Example  input 2 3 1000000 output 6  input 3 3 2 output 4   Regards, JSD

java					Each time a visitor requests a page from our website, our webserver writes a log entry recoding the visitor's identity and the kind of page requested.  Entries are written in chronological order to a plain-text file, with one entry per line.  The format of each entry is:   user-id      page-type-id    User IDs are arbitrary strings that uniquely represent a given user; if a user visits multiple pages, each log entry will have the same user ID.  Page type IDs are arbitrary strings that uniquely represent a given kind of page on our site, such as the homepage, a product detail pages, or the shopping cart. Tons of users visit our website, but there are only a few dozen types of pages.  We can use our weblogs to answer questions about user behavior.  One interesting question is: what is the most common three page sequence through the site?  E.g., if the most common pattern is to buy items advertised on the home page of the site, we might see the most common three page sequence as "Homepage -> ProductDetailPage -> ShoppingCart".  However, if customers spend a lot of time browsing the "Customers who bought this item also bought" feature, we might see the most common three page sequence as "ProductDetailPage -> ProductDetailPage -> ProductDetailPage".  Attached is a sample log file for your reference.  Within the first 10 lines of the sample, customer "234" travels through the sequences "Listmania -> ProductDetail -> Checkout" and "ProductDetail -> Checkout -> HomePage" once each.  For the sake of this test feel free to assume that everything will fit in memory.  Do keep in mind that given the size of our data sets, performance has to be considered, also, we will be looking at more than just correct output..

java					i was asked the following question and they need java solution for it.  Checkers is an ancient board game played by two players, traditionally called 'Black' and 'White'. It is played by turns on an 8x8 board, which has alternating black and white squares. All the pieces are placed on black squares only and move in a diagonal fashion, i.e., a piece cannot move vertically or horizontally, but only diagonally.  When it is a player's turn, he can either make a move or a sequence of jumps. A jump is defined as a diagonal move over exactly one piece of the opposing colour. The piece that has been jumped over is said to be captured, i.e., it is removed from the board. The players try to capture as many of the opponent's pieces as possible and the game ends when all the pieces of any one player are captured.   Checkers rule states that the white piece (A) has a choice of moving to his left, or jumping over the black piece. Since the intent of the game is to capture as many of the opponent's pieces as possible, White should choose 'A' to jump over the black piece. After jumping, 'A' reaches a square from which he can jump further, either left or right. The jump to the left is better because it allows White to make one more jump, unlike the jump to the right, which leads to no more jumps. The white piece (, in the figure, can only move and not jump. Thus, according to the figure, White can jump thrice in one turn, using 'A' or alternatively can move once using 'B'. Obviously, the better choice is jumping with A.  You have to write a program which, given a board configuration, calculates the maximum number of jumps possible in one turn, by any White piece. Given the board above, the program would output '3'.  Notes: It is illegal to jump over a piece of your own colour.  A player's turn is complete when he makes either a move or a sequence of jumps.  A jump can land only on an empty square.  Input specification: The input will consist of eight (8) lines of eight (8) characters each. The characters will be one of the set {B, W, ~, #}.   B => Black piece   W => White piece   ~ => An empty black square   # => White square. Note that a piece can never land on a white square  Output specification: Your program has to output the maximum number of jumps that can be made by any of the white pieces. If white cannot make any jump at all, then your program must print the integer '0' (zero)   Sample Input and Output:  Input: #B#~#B#~ B#B#B#B# #~#~#~#~ ~#B#~#~# #~#W#~#~ ~#~#~#~# #W#W#W#~ W#W#W#W#  Output: 4   Input: ~#~#~#~# #B#B#B#B ~#~#~#~# #B#B#~#~ ~#~#~#~# #~#B#~#~ ~#W#W#W# #W#W#W#W  Output: 5

java					on last interview lunatic server solution asked 3 questions. one of them was very easy. the problem states that... Given a stream of text, your task is to create a formatted paragraph out of it. The paragraph should be left justified and each line of text in the formatted paragraph should not exceed a given length. Each line should contain maximum possible characters.  In addition to the input text, a set of words with their possible hyphen positions will also be given. The hyphenation makes it possible sometimes to add incomplete words at the end of line, if the completed words overflow the line length limit. To indicate that this particular word is incomplete, a hyphen (-) is added at the end of such broken words. Remaining part of this word is placed at the beginning of the next line. The specified line length limit must be observed including the trailing hyphen character if any.  The input text will contain alphabets, digits, punctuation marks and spaces. The only white space character used is a blank space, which is used to separate words. Each line in a formatted paragraph begins with a non-blank character. Even if the input text has words separated by many spaces, your output should separate them by only single space or a line break.  Notes:  The list of hyphenated words will not include any punctuation marks that may occur in the text to be formatted. You may assume that the punctuation marks will occur only at the end of each word (alpha-numeric characters). That is there will not be words like They'll or Sita's anywhere in the input.  The word length will never exceed the line length limit.  The input text can always be formatted using the given constraints.  No word, hyphenated or otherwise will exceed a length of 20 characters.  Input specification: First line has an integer n denoting the number of hyphenated words.  Next n lines give each of the hyphenated word with possible hyphen break positions in the word by a hyphen itself. For example, "hyphenate" is given as "hy-phen-ate" and "formatting" is given as "for-mat-ting".  Next line will be an integer denoting the maximum number of characters per line in the formatted paragraph, i.e., the line length limit.  Last line contains the text to be formatted into a paragraph. The entire text will be terminated by a new line. The length of text will not exceed 256 characters.  Output specification: The output should be a sequence of characters, which begin each line of the formatted paragraph followed by a single new line character. Thus, there will be those many non-white space characters as there are lines in the formatted paragraph.  Sample Input and Output:  Input: 4 con-cept pro-gram-ming ob-vi-ous im-pos-si-ble 25 Most people find the concept of programming obvious, but the doing impossible.  Output: Mcos   Note :  Candidate can not get characters of indices, which are multiple of 24. you have to make program in java with proper coding and follow the problem statement.

java					Lunatic server solutions asked this problem for fresher recruitment in india. On monday we asked this problem for freshers. there was a very easy problem. problem states that...   You are required to write a program to do simple pattern matching, in a string. The string in which the pattern is to be found, henceforth referred to as Master String, can be composed of the following character sets:  a-z {any character in the range a to z}  A-Z {any character in the range A to Z}  0-9 {any digit in the range 0 to 9}  The pattern to be matched is also a string, henceforth referred to as Scan String. The Scan String can be composed of the above character sets, as well as two special characters, which are: '.' and '*'. The dot ('.') is to be interpreted as matching any one character from the above character sets and the star ('*') is interpreted as matching zero or more of the previously matched character. The Scan String may or may not contain the special characters.  A pattern is considered matched when the longest substring that satisfies the pattern is returned.  Input Specification  The first line of input contains the Master String.  The second line of input contains the Scan String.  Both Master String and Scan String will not be greater than 80 characters in length.  Output Specification Your program must output the length of the longest substring matched. If there is no match, then the length of the matched substring is zero.   Input:  abcd23Abdaaaa4g9 .*Abd.		{ dot-star-A-b-d-dot } Output:  10  Input:  aaadaaabbbb129cd a.*d		{ a-dot-star-d } Output:  16  Input:  0AbC1dEf2GhI3jKl4MnO5pQr6StU7vWx8Yz9 3JkL4		{ 3-J-k-L-4 } Output:  0  Input:  090m90mm90mmm90mm90m909 0m*9 Output:  5

java					Green Bricks asked this question for the post of project leader for their upcoming project. project engineer has to be in java. green bricks also offered attractive salary. the problem was as follows:  Given a set of figures and a board (a 2D array), you are required to figure out if all the figures can be placed on the board such that no two figures overlap each other. A figure can be of any shape and is represented using a matrix of 0s and 1s. The 1s in the matrix indicate the solid part that makes the figure.   Note:  Overlapping of 0s of figure A with 1s and 0s of figure B is allowed.  The figures provided are to be fitted as is without any rotation.  There is only one figure per matrix.  The matrix describing the figure will not have any empty row or column.  Input specification: The first line contains two integers M and N (0<=50 and 0<=50), the dimensions of the board. The board is empty at the start.  The second line contains an integer F (0<=F<=10), indicating the number of figures followed by F figures.  Each figure has two integers R and C, the dimensions of the matrix containing the figure followed by R lines containing C integers 0's or 1's separated by a space.  Output specification: If all the given figures fit onto the board then print YES followed by the number of empty cells on the board, separated by a space. If all the pieces cannot be fitted on the board together then print NO.  Sample Input and Output:  Input: 4 4 3 1 1 1 4 3 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 4 3 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0   Output: YES 0  this was the sample input output case. you have to make the program for this which should also work on the following test cases.

java					A newly established university in New York has its campus located in a remote corner of the city. The university offers several courses and students are required to take a certain number of these courses. Each course publishes its schedule of lectures on a day-wise basis, i.e., it publishes the days of the week on which it holds lectures. Each course chooses exactly three days of the week for lectures. Travelling to the university is a nuisance and all the students who attend courses there, seek to minimise the number of days that they should have to travel. Given each course's schedule, you have to help the students decide on a combination of courses, such that they minimise the number of days that they have to travel to the university.  The university has strict attendance norms and it insists that students should attend all the lectures that their respective course offers.  Assume that the number of courses required will never be greater than the number of courses offered. In addition, there will be a unique combination of days, which allows the students to take the required number of courses and minimise travel.  Input specification: First line will contain total number of courses (T) and the number of courses you are required to register (R) for.  The next T lines will each contain name of the course and those days on which the lectures for the course are held. The first word on each line is the name of the course and the rest of the words are three-letter words signifying the days of the week. E.g., "Physics MON WED FRI".  Output specification: You should output the names of the days on which the student is required to go to the University to attend lectures. These should be printed on a single line in sorted order (SUN to SAT) with a single whitespace as a separator. Terminate the output with a newline.   Sample Input and Output:  Input: 6 3 Physics        MON WED TUE Chemistry   TUE WED THU Biology        WED SAT THU Economics  MON FRI WED English        TUE WED FRI History  MON THU FRI  Output: MON TUE WED FRI   Input: 6 2 Physics        SUN TUE WED Chemistry   TUE WED THU Biology       THU WED FRI Economics  MON WED FRI English       THU TUE WED History       FRI MON THU  Output: TUE WED THU

java					write a program that displays the its source code as its output.

java					create an array and remove all the duplicates in the array.no duplicates are allowed in the array.display the contents of the array finally after the duplicates are removed.

java					An older has a very old computer at his house. It is so old that there is no notion of virtual memory in the operating system. Instead it uses a simple memory allocation technique called the 'Best Fit Algorithm'. The BFA works like this:  Whenever a request comes in for some memory space, the OS looks for the smallest, continuous empty space, which can satisfy it, and allocates a portion of this region to the program making the request. If such space cannot be found, the program is terminated and all the memory used by the program is freed. Any program can get terminated due to two reasons:  The program exits  Enough memory is not available to start the program or keep it running  All memory requests that come in at the same time-instant are processed in ascending order of process-id. If while processing, a program is terminated for lack of memory, all memory held by it is freed before processing any other request and no further memory requests by the terminated program are considered. All termination is also done in order of process-id.  You have to write a program to simulate this algorithm and print out the number of processes that were terminated due to lack of memory.  Note:  1.No process will request for memory before its start-time or after its end-time.  2.All memory sizes are specified in KB.  3.The memory is linear in nature, i.e., addresses do not wrap around. It starts at zero and goes up to N-1 KB.  4.At a given time unit, all processes that have reached end-time will be terminated (and memory freed) before other memory requests are serviced.  5.The total free space available in memory might be enough to satisfy a request, however the OS will terminate the process if a continuous region of empty space is not found  Input specification: First line has an integer N (0 < N <= 1000), size of the memory in KB.  Second line of input will have integer P (0 <= P <= 20), the total number of processes to be run on the system.  Next P lines will have data for each process in the following format:  <process-id> <start-time> <end-time> <initial-memory>  These input lines will be sorted in ascending order of the process-id.Process-id will be unique integers greater than zero.  Next line will have integer R (0<= R <= 20), which specifies the subsequent memory requests by any process.  Next R lines have the following format:  <process-id> <request-time> <memory-required>  Output specification: An integer specifying the number of processes that were terminated due to lack of memory  Sample Input and Output:  Input: 100 4 1 3 7 20 2 0 4 30 3 0 3 70 4 0 10 25 2 3 2 30 2 2 10   Output: 2  Input: 10 2 1 0 8 4 2 0 3 2 3 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 4 4   Output: 1

java					What is difference between following interface and abstract class:

java					Dr. Alberquert invented the following three devices to set up a simple communication network:  Synthesizer (S), which produces signals continuously and transmits (propagates / passes on) them to neighbouring cells but cannot receive signals.  Receiver (R), which can receive signals from neighbouring signal sources but cannot produce or propagate signal.  Transmitter (T), which is capable of both receiving signal from and transmitting signals to neighbouring cells. Transmitters also are NOT capable of producing signals.  These devices are laid in a matrix formation. Signals are propagated at the rate of one cell per time unit. The absorption rate of a receiver is unlimited and so also the transmission and absorption rate of a transmitter unlimited. For simplicity we shall ignore the exact nature of signals being produced and consider them uniform across sources. Devices on the extreme right side can also communicate with the extreme left hand side device present in the same row (see fig 2). Similarly a device on the extreme top can also communicate with a device at the extreme bottom if they are present in the same column.  Please Note:  Neighbourhood is a four cell neighbourhood, i.e, the neighbourhood of a cell is defined by cells to its NORTH, SOUTH, EAST and WEST (see fig 1).  All Synthesizers will start to produce signals as soon as the simulation begins.  There could be multiple Synthesizers in a matrix arrangement.     Your task is to write a program that would take a matrix containing devices and output the time at which each receiver/transmitter receives its first signal.  Input specification: The first line has two integers M and N indicating the number of rows and columns of the matrix. 0 < M, N <= 20  M lines follow the first line. Each of these M lines contains N characters and a terminating new line. Each character is one of S, T or R.  Output specification: The output should be a matrix of M rows with each row containing N integers separated by spaces indicating the minimum time required for the signal to reach the corresponding device. The output for cells containing Synthesizers is 0. For devices that never receive any signal, print -1.  Sample Input and Output:  Input: 3 4 SRTR TTTT TTTS   Output: 0 1 3 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 0    Input: 2 3 RTT TTR   Output: -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

java					Given a matrix of order M x N containing 1.s and 0's, you have to find the number of maximal squares that can be formed. A square is formed by grouping adjacent cells containing 1. A maximal square is one that is not completely contained within another square. Maximal squares that overlap partially are to be counted separately. Unit squares (length of side = 1) should be also counted.  Note that squares are filled, i.e. they cannot contain 0.s.   Number of maximal square: 6  Input specification: The first line consists of integers M and N, the number of rows and columns of the matrix. 0 < M and N <=40  Next M lines contain N characters from the set {0, 1}.  Output specification: An integer representing the number of maximal squares that can be formed followed by a newline.  Sample Input and Output:  Input: 4 5 11001 11110 11011 11001   Output: 9    Input: 2 2 10 11   Output: 3

java					KingKong, the largest living ape, escaped from Xanadu lab into a forest. The forest is filled with dangerous animals, which will attack and kill human beings that venture too close to them. You are required to help the scientists find a way to get to KingKong safely. The table below gives the minimum distance one must keep from each species for safety.  Animal Name  Code  Safety distance (unit cell)  Lion L 1   Panther P 2   Both, the animals as well as the scientists can move only in horizontal or vertical directions. So, in the figure, the cells shaded gray are the cells into which the scientists must NOT venture, in order to be safe. The arrow shows that the panther is one vertical and one horizontal (a total of two) cell away from it.   A snapshot of the forest is obtained from a satellite picture in terms of an MxN matrix, which is the input to your program. This snapshot gives the location of various animals in the forest. Some cells might contain trees, which merely block the path of the scientists. The cells within the snapshot are marked by:  Animal code indicating the animal present in the cell  'T' in case of a tree present in the cell  'S', which indicates the start position of the scientists  'K', KingKong's location  '#', All other cells, which are empty  The output of your program should be the number of steps in the path that the scientists should take.  Notes:  There will be a unique path, if one exists.  The entire path including the starting position of the scientist as well as KingKong's location must be safe.  Input specification: The first line contains two integers M and N the number of rows and columns. The next M lines contain N characters from the set {'L', 'P', 'T', 'S', 'K', '#'} as explained above  Output specification: An integer specifying the length of the path, from the starting position of the scientist, to KingKong's position both inclusive. If KingKong is not reachable safely, then output the integer '-1'.

java					You have been asked to deploy a number of robotic domestic helpers (RDH) into a large room to remotely clean it as they move around it. This room is currently rectangular in shape and must be navigated by the RDHs in order to successfully clean the room.  A RDH position and location is represented by a combination of x and y co-ordinates and a letter representing one of the four cardinal compass points. The room is divided up into a grid to simplify navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the RDH is in the bottom left corner and facing North.  In order to control a RDH the operator sends a simple string of letters. The possible letters are 'L', 'R' and 'M'. 'L' and 'R' makes the robot spin 90 degrees left or right respectively, without moving from its current spot.  'M' means move forward one grid point, and maintain the same heading.  Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).  INPUT: The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the arena, the lower-left coordinates are assumed to be 0,0.  The rest of the input is information pertaining to the RDHs that have been deployed. Each RDH has two lines of input. The first line gives the RDHs initial deployed position, and the second line is a series of instructions telling the RDH how to navigate around the room.  The position is made up of two integers and a letter separated by spaces, corresponding to the x and y co-ordinates and the RDHs orientation.  Each RDH will be finished sequentially, which means that the second RDH won't start to move until the first one has finished moving.   OUTPUT The output for each RDH should be its final co-ordinates and heading.  INPUT AND OUTPUT  Test Input: 7 6 2 4 E MMRMMRMRRM 3 4 N LMLMLMLMM  Expected Output: 4 2 E 43e3 5 N

What if I need to add 2 jokers to the deck of 52 cards.  3. Data Structures: How will you use a hashtable to find data in a tree. (Then he rephrased) suppose I have a hashtable, I want to store the data in a tree instead of a bucket. How will I do it. What complexity to find an element.  4. Bits & Bytes: Find if a binary representation of a number is palindrome. The function should work irrespective of number of bytes for an integer. Suppose if our machine is 4 bytes for an int, how will you use the program for 8 byte machine.  5. Unix: Suppose I have 100's of html files in many directories. I want to find the files having phone numbers.   b) Suppose I have 2 files having phone numbers, find the repeating phone numbers. (I said sort and grep). Then he asked what if the lines cannot be sorted.   All the best guys. I think the second interview was challenging since the interviewer was prodding until he heard a leave me alone. So it means that though they are based on questions in cc, be prepared for extensions. I think this site is all you need to prepare for Amazon interview.

brain-teasers					Just a disclaimer: I doubt you will ever get this interview question. My interviewer even started off by saying, "Hmm, well this isn't really fair, but..." So don't place too much stock in whether or not you can solve this.  Question: You have a group of pigs and buckets of food for said pigs. There are 1,000 buckets of food, and exactly 1 of them is poisoned. Your goal is to determine, by the end of 1 hour, which bucket is poisoned.  The poison takes 30 minutes to kill a pig, and you'd like to kill as few pigs as possible. The number of pigs you can test is limitless, and you can assign a number to each bucket and each pig so that you know exactly which pig ate from which bucket(s). You determine which buckets to feed to which pigs, but you have no timer and no way to guesstimate the time. What is the minimum number of pigs you need to use to solve the problem?

brain-teasers					/* Prison cell question In a kingdom there are prison cells (numbered 1 to P) built to form a straight line segment. Cells number i and i+1 are adjacent, and prisoners in adjacent cells are called "neighbors." A wall with a window separates adjacent cells, and neighbors can communicate through that window. All prisoners live in peace until a prisoner is released. When that happens, the released prisoner's neighbors find out, and each communicates this to his other neighbor. That prisoner passes it on to his other neighbor, and so on until they reach a prisoner with no other neighbor (because he is in cell 1, or in cell P, or the other adjacent cell is empty). A prisoner who discovers that another prisoner has been released will angrily break everything in his cell, unless he is bribed with a gold coin. So, after releasing a prisoner in cell A, all prisoners housed on either side of cell A - until cell 1, cell P or an empty cell - need to be bribed. Assume that each prison cell is initially occupied by exactly one prisoner, and that only one prisoner can be released per day. Given the list of Q prisoners to be released in Q days, find the minimum total number of gold coins needed as bribes if the prisoners may be released in any order. Note that each bribe only has an effect for one day. If a prisoner who was bribed yesterday hears about another released prisoner today, then he needs to be bribed again.  Task: find the minimum amount of gold we need to bribe the prisoners so that the chosen prisoners can be released without causing cell destruction. Input example: 8 cells, 1 prisoner has to be released. The prisoner to be released is the 3rd one. |1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8| 7 gold coins another example: 20 cells, 3 prisoners to be released: 3, 6 and 14 |1|2| |4|5| |7|8|9|10|11|12|13| |15|16|17|18|19|20| release prisoner 3: 19 gold coins release prisoner 6: 16 gold coins release prisoner 14: 13 gold coins  release 14: 19 gold coins release 6: 12 gold coins release 3: 4 gold coins  input: number of cells prisoners that need to be released output: least number of gold coins we need to give */

brain-teasers					Organization has online services running across world. To use online services, User create account by entering personal details like - First Name, Last Name, Phone number, Address and etc...  Russia has passed new law that any Russian citizen who is creating account to use online services, his account information needs to store in Russia first and then read-only copies allowed to replicate across the world. Please suggest cost effective solution/design for this scenario otherwise online services will be blocked to use in Russia. How do we handle if any other country Germany is also come up with this law?  Issues: 1. Do  not have mechanism to identify citizenship of user.  2.

brain-teasers					You are given an array of n unique integer numbers 0 <= x_i < 2 * n Print all integers 0 <= x < 2 * n that are not present in this array. Example: find_missing([0]) = [1] find_missing([0, 2, 4]) = [1, 3, 5] # because all numbers are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] find_missing([]) = [] find_missing([0, 1, 4, 5]) = [2, 3, 6, 7] # because all numbers are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  Quirks are about requirements:  Time complexity O(n) - BUT there should be some fixed constant C independent of size of input such that every element of array is written/read < C times, so radix sorting the array is a no go.  Space complexity O(1) - you may modify the initial array, BUT sorted(initial_array) must equal sorted(array_after_executing_program) AND you can't store integers outside range [0, 2n) in this array (imagine that it's an array of uint32_t).

brain-teasers					You are given a flat room 1x1 metres, a position of victim in it (v_x, v_y) and a position of a killer (k_x, k_y) both inside this room (in range [0, 1]). Then the killer shoots once at some direction. The bullet reflects of the walls as if it was a light ray - if it falls under angle X degrees, it will reflect at angle X  degrees, if it gets into the corner it just reflects back. If the bullet hits guardian (see below) it stops and killer fails. Write a function that will be given coordinates of victim and a killer and will return a list of coordinates of guardians such that it's impossible for a killer to kill victim.  That is, whichever direction the killer will shoot, the bullet will never reach victim, or will be stopped by a guardian.  Here is an example for the case when we assume the walls don't reflect bullet (for simplicity): killer: (0, 0), victim: (1, 1). The solution to this simplified problem is to place 1 guardian between killer and victim e.g. on (0.1, 0.1).  Your task is to do this with accounting bullet reflection. E.g. in the previous case the killer can shoot at (1/3, 1), the bullet will reflect to (2/3, 0) and finally get to the victim at (1, 1).

brain-teasers					Unable to get what exactly the Question Is?  so What is the whole logic behind this question .It seems to be  complete Math problem to me.  There is a Grasshopper in a tropical forest. The grasshopper can jump only vertically and horizontally, and the length of jump is always equal to x centimeter. A GRasshopper has found herself at the center of some cell of the chess board of the size pxq centimeters(each cell is 1x1 centimeters). She can jump as she wishes for an arbitrary number of times, she can even visit a cell more than once. the only restriction is that she cannot jump out of the board. The grasshopper can count the number of cells that she can reach from the starting position(x,y). Let's denote this amount by dx,y. your task is to find the number of such starting position(x,y), which have the maximum possible value of dx,y Input The integer array contains three integers p,q,x  p= length of the board q= width of the board x=length of the grasshoppers jump.

brain-teasers					There is a fictional company called fooBar in fooLand. The CEO of fooBar, fooMan, directs all managers to minimize the total hike that they give to employees, while ensuring that the hike is fair to them. Usually, this is done by giving more hike to employees who are rated better. So, for example, if an employee is rated 2 and is given hike 3x, an employee rated 3 should be given a hike greater than 3x. Hikes are always in multiples of x only and the minimum hike to be given to any employee is x.  This year, however, a wicked manager, barMan comes up with a brilliant strategy. He assumes that each employee would get to know the hike of only the two employees who sit next to him (one on the left, one on the right). And therefore, he reasons(using whole of his analytical left brain), that as long as he could make hikes fair for each employee with respect to the two employees that sit next to him, he would fulfill the dual objective of being "fair" as well as minimizing the total hike given. Just for clarification, the employees of each team sit in one big line.   barMan hires you to calculate the hike to be given to each employee. Over to you. You are supposed to come up with the total hike number that will excite barMan and make him roll on the floor laughing. You are given that no two employee sitting next to each other would have a common rating.  Input:  The order of rating of each employee should be in the order in which they sit. First line will be the value of x. The second line will be the number of employees 'n'. The next 'n' lines specify the rating of each employee. Rating can be integers from 1 to 105. (weird, right?)   1 <= n <= 105. 1 <= x <= 104.  Sample input 1:  10 4 1 4 6 2  Output: 70  Why? If we have the hikes as first employee gets 10, second gets 20, third gets 30 and fourth gets 10, we satisfy all our constraints.

brain-teasers					4th interview was w/ the tech lead. Asked a puzzle question and told me to use a recursive algorithm. A grasshopper wants to cross a river onto the other side. Partition the length he was to cross into intervals. Each interval either has a at most 1 stone or none. The grasshopper has to jump on the stones to cross the river. It has a speed which is the number of intervals/jump. Initially speed is 0. To get to the 1st stone, speed has to be 1. Given a boolean river array telling if an interval has a stone, call another recursive function to see if it's possible for the grasshopper to cross the river. Speed can only be decreased by one, same, or increased by one. Didn't fully complete this function but he told me I was awefully close.

The discussion went on for 30 minutes and at the end He laughed at it and claimed that its not a real distributed system!He then asked following C++ questions:1. Can you have private destructor and private constructor ? explain your answer.2. Can you have virtual constructor ? explain your answer. 3. What design pattern is similar to virtual constructor ?4. Can you have vector of auto_pointer ? explain your answer.5. is this code valid:   auto_pointer<Object> a(new Object());   auto_pointer<Object> b(new Object());   a = b;  My Answer: Yes its valid ( I checked in the book later)  but he insisted that this is invalid code! what an idiot.If he comes on the phone to interview you, just say "No Thanks!"

trees-and-graphs					One of the many ways of representing a tree is to have an array(of length same as number of nodes), where each element in the node denotes the parent of that node.											  Eg - {-1, 0, 0, 1, 1} would represent a tree with - * 0 as root * 1 and 2 as children of 0 * 3 and 4 as children of 1  Given a similar representation, you have to print reverse level order traversal of the corresponding tree.  Level order traversal of a tree is where we traverse levels of tree one by one.  Eg - For the above given tree, level order traversal would be - 0 1 2 3 4 And hence, the reverse level order traversal is - 3 4 1 2 0 Please note - * An element with parent = -1 is the root element. * An element with the least index becomes the left most child. (ie. a node with always be on left of all its siblings that have higher index than it) * When printing a level of tree you need to maintain left to right order.  Input Format - First line of the input contains number of nodes in the tree (N) Next line contains N (space seperated) numbers that denote where i-th number will denote the parent node of i-th node.  Output Format - Print reverse level order traversal of the corresponding tree, with every new level starting in a different line. Notes/Limits - * 1 <= N <= 50 * There will be only one root element in any given test case * Given numbers will always form a valid undivided tree * Output should be in the exact format as specified (including whitespaces) Sample Test Cases -	 		 Input - 5 -1 0 0 2 1 Output - 4 3 1 2 0  Input - 9 8 7 0 5 5 8 7 0 -1 Output - 1 6 2 7 3 4 0 5 8 Input - 45 24 42 4 30 29 43 22 15 26 36 26 16 3 22 21 41 18 16 34 41 12 29 32 30 43 15 4 38 36 -1 24 42 18 6 21 38 6 17 32 17 3 34 12 14 14 Output - 1 31 20 42 9 28 12 40 33 36 3 23 37 39 6 13 27 35  0 30 11 17 22 38 7 25 5 24 16 32 15 19 8 10 43 44 18 41 2 26 14 34 4 21 29  Input - 33 17 25 0 14 7 2 5 25 18 8 16 27 10 9 19 7 31 31 19 0 8 14 9 17 18 2 30 16 30 10 5 -1 27 Output - 13 22 26 28 4 15 9 20 6 30 1 7 3 21 8 24 5 25 14 18 12 29 11 32 2 19 10 27 0 23 16 17 31

trees-and-graphs					Find cousins of a given node in a Binary tree and  BST.  My Approach:

trees-and-graphs					Question 1 / 1 (Path Explosion EASY) You were given a Binary Tree (not necessarily a Binary Search Tree) to play with, say T. T had some special properties  Each internal node in T had exactly 2 children Each internal node in T was represented by an uppercase English alphabet (A-Z) Each leaf node in T was represented by a lowercase English alphabet (a-z) You were told remember T as long as you could. Hence, you memorised the string formed by traversing T in post-order. You used something similar to the pseudocode below  toPostOrderString (node)     if node is leaf         return node.value     else         T = ""         T = T + toPostOrderString(node.left)         T = T + toPostOrderString(node.right)         T = T + node.value         return T Now, time has come to use that string again. The Eye has contacted you. Yes, the secret organisation mentioned in "Now you see me" ( don't tell anyone they are real !! )  You remember the string you memorised back then. You must reconstruct the binary tree T. You are also given a string A. All the characters of A are uppercase English alphabets. Let us assume that T has L leaves. Then, there will be exactly L paths from the root to the leaves - 1 unique path to each leaf.  You have to tell The Eye the number of paths out of L, on which, A exists as a sub-sequence. Look at the explanation for the Sample Case 1 for clarity.  You have to implement the method explodePaths in the code. explodePaths is passed the following parameters, respectively  N, the number of nodes in T S, the string representation of the post-order traversal of T. Of course, the length of S will be equal to N. K, the length of the string A A, the string you must find in the paths from the root of T, to the leaves in T. Note  It is not necessary that T is balanced. But, each internal node always has exactly 2 children. It is possible that both those children are internal nodes also. It is possible that only one of those children is an internal node. For the given string S, because of the constraint that each internal node has exactly 2 children, you will always be able to determine the tree T, uniquely. It is not necessary that all characters in T are unique. There may be several nodes with the same value. In this problem statement, by sub-sequence we mean not necessarily contiguous. This is different from a sub-string. Do not print the answer in explodePaths. Just return the value. The code-template interviewstreet provides does the input and output itself. Consider the following tree     A   / \  t   B     / \    /   \   B     A  / \   / \ x   y a   b This tree is given in Sample Case 1 as  N = 9 S = "txyBabABA" K = 2 A = "AA" Now, there are 5 leaf nodes, and hence, 5 paths from the root to leaves - 1 for each leaf.  - A-t - A-B-B-x - A-B-B-y - A-B-A-a - A-B-A-b Out of these 5 paths, you have to find the number of paths, on which "AA" exists as a sub-sequence. Of course, there are only 2 such paths  - A-B-A-a - A-B-A-b Hence the expected answer is 2.  In the same T above  The answer for A = "BB", is 2 The answer for A = "BA", is 2 The answer for A = "AB", is 4 The answer for K = 1 and A = "A", is 5 The answer for K = 1 and A = "B", is 4 The Sample Case 2 has a little more complicated T. The string S in Sample Case 2 is yeBgeuCBxAB.  Constraints  N  10000 K  100 The expected time complexity of the algorithm is O(N).

trees-and-graphs					lunatic server solution is monitoring the wrong file entry in the server. so company made another a problem for it to monitor AVL tree violation. The problem should be solved in java... problem states that...   This problem requires you to monitor a tree for violation of the AVL balance criteria as the tree is being constructed. The input to the program consists of a sequence of numbers. As you read in each number, check where the node is going to be inserted into the current tree. [At the start, the tree is empty.] If that insertion can cause the balance of any of the nodes in the tree to go beyond what is allowed by the AVL criteria, DO NOT add the number into the tree. Instead, print out the number into the standard output. Numbers which retain the AVL property of the tree should be added to the tree at the appropriate place as per the method discussed in class. Continue with the remaining numbers. Please note that you do not have to do any balancing of the tree! The input is terminated by 1. The output from the program consists of the numbers rejected by the program. At the end, you should also print out the count of such numbers rejected. Hint: It would help to keep the height of the left and right subtrees of each node along with the node. Also note that the process of checking for violation and actually inserting are quite similar; in the former case you do not update anything but do everything else. This observation can be used to write the code. Sample Input/Output Input 3 5 1 6 2 4 9 7 -1 Output 7 1 (This means rejected key(s) are: key 7, totally 1 rejected key)

string-manipulation					Programming Challenge Description:  Develop a service to help a client quickly find a manager who can resolve the conflict between two employees. When there is a conflict between two employees, the closest common manager should help resolve the conflict. The developers plan to test the service by providing an example reporting hierarchy to enable the identification of the closest common manager for two employees. Your goal is to develop an algorithm for IBM to efficiently perform this task. To keep things simple, they just use a single relationship "isManagerOf" between any two employees. For example, consider a reporting structure represented as a set of triples:  Tom isManagerOf Mary Mary isManagerOf Bob Mary isManagerOf Sam Bob isManagerOf John Sam isManagerOf Pete Sam isManagerOf Katie  The manager who should resolve the conflict between Bob and Mary is Tom(Mary's manager). The manager who should resolve the conflict between Pete and Katie is Sam(both employees' manager). The manager who should resolve the conflict between Bob and Pete is Mary(Bob's manager and Pete's manager's manager).   Assumptions: There will be at least one isManagerOf relationship. There can be a maximum of 15 team member to a single manager No cross management would exist i.e., a person can have only one manager There can be a maximum of 100 levels of manager relationships in the corporation  Input:  R1,R2,R3,R4...Rn,Person1,Person2 R1...Rn - A comma separated list of "isManagerOf" relationships. Each relationship being represented by an arrow "Manager->Person". Person1,Person2 - The name of the two employee that have conflict Output:  The name of the manager who can resolve the conflict Note: Please be prepared to provide a video follow-up response to describe your approach to this exercise.  Test 1: Test Input  Frank->Mary,Mary->Sam,Mary->Bob,Sam->Katie,Sam->Pete,Bob->John,Bob,Katie   Expected Output  Mary   Test 2: Test Input  Sam->Pete,Pete->Nancy,Sam->Katie,Mary->Bob,Frank->Mary,Mary->Sam,Bob->John,Sam,John  Expected Output  Mary

Write a code that returns if an string is palindrome and  it should return true for above input. (Without directly saying, I should conclude that I have to only consider alphanumerical characters in a string). In addition, we assume the string is very long and we can not keep a copy of this string or even a copy of preprocessed version of this string. Therefore the result should be returned with the first sweep of the string.

system-design					Please share your thoughts over this designing question (If you need any more info, pls. do let me know): GIVEN: Let's say we have a popular eCommerce site with lots of sellers and millions of products. The system has a CatalogManager Service which is being called by various seller platforms to update info (attributes) about seller and it's products. For e.g. Seller can say 'Hey, my brand name has changed to New_Brand', 'Hey, My Product P1 weight has changed to 6kg'. The catalog manager service has it's own datastore and cache in place where it goes and update accordingly. Imagine the sclae of these update requests to be very high as we have thousands of sellers and millions of products and each may have 50-60 attributes which could be chaned. The CatalogManager service is able to handle all these updates smartly.  TO DESIGN: There are various other back-end services (ShippingService, SearchService) in the system who must me notified about these changes in REAL TIME. For e.g. ShippingService must be notified by CatalogManager that 'Hey, Product P1 of seller S1 weight has changed to 6 kg'. Other example, SearchService must be notified that 'Hey, Seller S1 brand name has changed to New_Brand' so that it can change it's index to be searched.  * Design such a system which can scale & is fault tolerant ensuring all edge cases including one mentioned below:-  * Every back-end service may not be interested in all the events. It may only wish to listen subset of attributes. E.g. ShippingService may only want if product dimension related attributes change. So how will you ensure that only related messages reach to consumer services?  * How will you ensure that event message published by producer service (CatalogManager) reacheed to the related consumer service for sure and in REAL TIME?  * How can you ensure the messages passed to backend services are in sync (in order it's important)  * How to ensure that same event is not messaged twice to the consumers? Although, eventually it will result in same data state but still looking at scale of the events this would be a burden to backend system  How would you design such a system?

system-design					Write a Program for Dictionary which has functionality of lookup and insert . This program should be able to add words on the fly   I wrote simple code using HashTable   follow up   1) Now we are getting too many words what happens  me: Hashtable will dynamically resize resulting into performance hit . Also they might get hashed to same location as well as we might run out of main memory   2) Okay you are out of main memory , How will you scale this program  me: I will create buckets of HashTable lets say 26 buckets for one for each alphabet and would put them on different machines   3) Lets say you are out of memory on those machines too  me: Okay I need to put them on secondary storage . Here we can have fileSystem or Database . I chose database . I will create simple DB schema of BucketNumber and word .   I will use buckets on main memory as cache , if we are not able to find a word in the bucket then query databse with bucket number and words then remove the least number times looked up word (every time we lookup a word we increament the count i.e value in key,value pair on hashtable) from that bucket and add this word .   I mentioned that bottleneck in this case will be every time a word is not present we need to query DB which usually has high latency which will result into performance hit   4) Lets say we are okay with latency but what if we are getting inserting words between that are only between only in two buckets ex. words starting from a and b only.  Now that I think about it, is it better to do this in a trie? What do you guys think?

computer-architecture-low-level					We tend to use computer to solve practical problems that actually earns or save dollars. Here is something that happens across the stock exchanges : people buy and sell stocks. We generally use automated intelligent systems to buy and sell stocks. That part is too much mathematics, and beyond scope of this interview. There is another part. Suppose the system issues a buy order : buy 1000 Microsoft stock. Now, there are more than 1 ( in fact 10 ) active exchanges from where we can buy MSFT.  There is a slight price delta, which keeps changing over time. There is another problem. In each stock exchange, prices are stacked, that is : 1. For first 100 stocks prices are 55$. 2. Next 200 stocks, prices are 55.2$. ... etc, and you got the idea. Even this stacks are changing over time.  Thus, here is the problem to solve. Design and implement a system such that one can buy  n stocks with minimal price. Also, in the same spirit, the same system should be able to sell n stocks with maximum payoff possible.  This is a non trivial problem, for Quant systems. There are always k no of exchanges to hit.

computer-architecture-low-level					I was asked to design a trading system, where there will be no of buyers and sellers will transact. The system need to have low latency, the buyers will quote no of  shares, company name, price they want to buy, the sellers will quote the price they want to sell for given company, and no of shares. The system has to match the buyers and sellers and transact. This is more of design question.   I was thinking in terms of  a hashmap kind a structure where the key will hash to the given company, and then there will be buckets for no of shares for buyers, with different buckets for prices, the idea is to look up in memory sellers, if a match is found then make the transaction. If the in memory data exceeds a limit implement a caching, and push the older data to the persistent store. The guy was'nt convinced this was a good design. Can someone suggest how is real time trading systems implemented, do they go for low latency queues.

computer-architecture-low-level					Q) Lets say you have a disk of size N with N blocks. Every block stores part of a file. Every file starts from a single block. The block size is not enough to store a file. Every block has a used/unused bit and a pointer to the next block in the disk which will store the next part of the fileand so on. A block which stores the end of a file points to null. Also a block whose unused bit is 0 doesnt point to anything and is not pointed to by any block.Now u have an index of files with filename as index and the value as the first block in which the file starts.Lets says u somehow lose these indices and values. How will you find an efficient algorithm to recreate this index structure with values. You can use any filenames while creating the indices.(While solving one shld think of cases where the file starts at block 4 which points to 1 then to 2 and ends at 3)

linked-lists					I had first round of phone interview today. She asked me to write two very simple codes in C++ and dictate her as I write. She was also writing the code as I was coding. The questions were:  1. Write code to find nth node (from front) in a linked list. 2. Write code to find minimum node in a BST.  Then test cases for both of these questions. Then the same question which need use of "uniq" command of UNIX.

problem-solving					You have a guy who is walking on a street with "X" doors on one side (say left side).From the third round, He has to walk "X" rounds to and fro( from point A, starting point to B, ending point). So he walks "X" times from A to B, and back "X" times. First two rounds he just walks to and fro.  Every time he walks he closes the particular doors corresponding to the number of the round of his walk, starting from the third round. So at the third round, he closes the third door, sixth door, ninth door, .... upto "X", if "X" is a multiple of 3, "X-1", if "X-1" is a multiple of 3 AND "X-2", if "X-2" is a multiple of 3  Then he walks till the "X" door. This he does for every round, till the "Xth" round.  So, if X is 300, he walks upto the 300th door, closes the 300th door and returns. If X is 400, he closes upto 399th door, goes till the 400th door and returns. If X is 500, he closes upto 498th door, goes till the 500th door and returns.  While returning, he just does nothing. He  just returns to where he started i.e. POINT A.  Likewise for the fourth round, where he close doors that are multiples of 4 i.e. 4, 8, 12, 16, etc till X (Similar calc as in the 3rd round, except that we consider multiples of 4 here).  And so on till the "Xth" round.  I.E. This continiues till "X" rounds. So, from 3 to X rounds. Note that we have not included 1st and 2nd rounds.  Problem here is:  Write the code in any language of your choice to find: What is the minimum number of the round where he would not have to close any door?

problem-solving					You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble fitting them into the time constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities! So you write a program to do it for you.      The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.     Each session contains multiple talks.     Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish by 12 noon, for lunch.     Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.     The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.     No talk title has numbers in it.     All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).     Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.

problem-solving					You're the guard of a prison, you want to keep an eye on the most dangerous prisoner. Each prisoner has a danger rank of his own and a group of friends (prisoners, who also have danger ranks). The guard has a list of prisoners with their corresponding danger ranks and he also has a list of the friends of each of the prisoners in the prison.  The danger rank is computed as follows: Prisoner 1 has a danger value of 5, his friends are Prisoner 2 and Prisoner 5, who have danger values of 3 and 4 respectively. So the danger value of Prisoner 1 is 5+3+4 = 12.  There could be any number of prisoners. Whichever prisoner has the highest value is the most dangerous(computed using the above method).  Friendship can be assumed to be symmetric.  Come up with an efficient algorithm to find the most dangerous prisoner?  The solution I came up with runs in quadratic time.  A hash table which has the Prisoner as Key and list of his friends as value Compute the sum of danger rank of all friends one key at a Time. (n * N) Maintain a max count and update it as necessary. I believe there is a solution for this problem having better time complexity than O(N^2).

math-computation					We tend to use computer to solve practical problems that actually earns or save dollars. Here is something that happens across the stock exchanges : people buy and sell stocks. We generally use automated intelligent systems to buy and sell stocks. That part is too much mathematics, and beyond scope of this interview. There is another part. Suppose the system issues a buy order : buy 1000 Microsoft stock. Now, there are more than 1 ( in fact 10 ) active exchanges from where we can buy MSFT.  There is a slight price delta, which keeps changing over time. There is another problem. In each stock exchange, prices are stacked, that is : 1. For first 100 stocks prices are 55$. 2. Next 200 stocks, prices are 55.2$. ... etc, and you got the idea. Even this stacks are changing over time.  Thus, here is the problem to solve. Design and implement a system such that one can buy  n stocks with minimal price. Also, in the same spirit, the same system should be able to sell n stocks with maximum payoff possible.

sorting					It was an over email interview:  Write a program that takes as input a sufficiently large text document (several are available online for testing; e.g. via Project Gutenberg), and produces as output (via stdout) an alphabetical listing of each unique word in the document (case insensitive and space separated, though be careful to consider hyphenated words), along with the lines from the input document that the word appears on. Each unique word (and the list of lines that it appears on) should be on a separate line in the output.  For example, taking the following text as input:  This is some kind OF text it Is an example of text  The following would be the output:  an 3 example 3 is 1 3 it 2 kind 2 of 2 3 some 2 text 2 3 this 1

How will you return a single sorted stream which contains all the streams data.

sorting					Given a array where each element is maximum +-k index away from it's sorted position, find an algorithm to sort such array.

sorting					This was asked in an Online written test that was timed (60 mins). And this question was one among the three.  "Write a method to merge three sorted integer arrays into just one array"  Nothing more or less was given. Since it was a written test I assumed that the 1st array had space towards to end which can fit the other two arrays. I can code this but given the timer limitations (of 20 mins per question) I thought it was a bit too much for me to handle unless there is a more obvious way to do this. I did it using two arrays and using the resultant array, I merged it with the 3rd array. That was the best i could think of at that time.

sorting					{{ There are 3 machines M1, M2 and M3. Each machine is 90% full of its capacity with integers. Now you have to sort all the integers combined and then store the first 1/3rd in M1, second 1/3rd in M2 and last 1/3rd in M3.   Your objective is to minimize the number of sort operations and number of data transfer operations. Each sort operation/data transfer operation is counted as 1 irrespective of the count of values that are being sorted/transferred.  }}

sorting					An efficient way to sort patient files in an array of just 3 types 'High-importance', 'Mid-importance', 'Low-importance' which are in an arbitrary order (unsorted).

sorting					I have 10 million 10-bit integers to sort, how would you sort them and what's the time complexity?   Follow-on question: Instead of sorting integers, I now have 10 million pairs to sort. Each pair consists of a 10-bit integer and an object, the sort order is determined by the 10-bit integer. Will your original sort algorithm hold or do you need sort it differently?  (A word of advice: Ask as many questions as you want during the interview, but you MUST be quick. Also, don't mention anything until you've thought it through clearly, otherwise you're just inviting more questions. Time is of essence, you're too slow if this question takes you more than 15 minutes to come up with the optimal solution, because remember, you have to leave time for explanations and other questions)

sorting					We have n number of sorted array for fixed length. Now we have to merge  these and need to save finaly result array into given array. Note- we can't use extra space except the given array.

sorting					(screening round) Given two sorted arrays, merge them into result array with sorting. Time and Space Complexity.

sorting					Given an array containing sequence of bits (0 or 1), you have to sort this array in the ascending order i.e. all 0' in first part of array followed by all 1's.   The constraints is that you can swap only the adjacent elements in the array. Find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the given input array.      Example:   Given the array (0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1) the minimum number of swaps is 3.        Note: You just need  to complete the function given  below for this task. The function is given a binary string as input and returns the required answer.

sorting					Sort an array of characters in linear time complexity (and linear space complexity if that's possible).

sorting					Write a method to sort an array of strings so that all the anagrams are next to each other.

sorting					In this problem, you have to implement a variation of Insertion Sort as described below. Suppose X is an array of N positive integers to be sorted. In this scheme, another array Y is used to store the sorted integers. This array is to be viewed as a circular array, ie. index (N-1)+1 = index 0 and index 0-1 = index N-1. The sorted integers get stored in a circular manner in Y, ie, it is possible that the index of the smallest integer may be greater than the index of the largest integer. Eg. 6 8 _ _ _ 1 2 4 5 is a view of the array Y sometime into the algorithm. _ indicates unused locations of the array. Smallest integer 1 is at index 5, largest integer 8 is at index 1. So the sorted array in Y is to be generated by printing the contents from index 5 to 1, assuming the array wraps around at the end, ie. after index 8, the next index is 0. Assume that h holds the index of the smallest integer in Y and t holds the index of the largest integer in Y. Initially,      1. h = t = 0      2. Y[0] = X[0] ie. the first integer in X[] is copied as the first integer in Y[].      3. All other elements in Y[] are initialised to a dummy value -1. The rest of the integers in X[] are now inserted one by one into Y[] such that Y[] always contains a sorted list of integers, with the smallest integer at index h and the largest at index t. This is done in the following manner: Let I be the next integer from X[] to be inserted into Y[]. Scan the array Y downwards from index h (with wrap-around at the end) till index t and find out the place in Y[] where I has to fit in. If I fits in at either end of the list, then insert it at the appropriate place in Y[]. Modify either t or h as appropriate to indicate the new array structure; ie. either t is incremented or h is decremented (with wrap-around). If I fits in somewhere in the middle of the list, then I should be inserted by shifting all the S smaller integers one place to the left or by shifting all the L larger integers one place to the right, depending on the number of integers to be shifted. That is, if S < L, the smaller integers should be shifted one place to the left and if S >= L, the larger integers should be shifted one place to the right. Again either h or t should be modified appropriately. Example Integers to be sorted X[]: 25 57 37 48 12 92 86 33 Contents of Y[] after inserting each integer from X[]:                                            Initially (t=0, h=0) 25 1 1 1 1 1 1 1                                            57 fits in at end (t=1) 25 57 1 1 1 1 1 1                                            37 fits in middle, S=1, L=1, so shift 57 right. (t=2) 25 37 57 1 1 1 1 1                                            48 fist in middle, S=2, L=1, So shift 57 right. (t=3) 25 37 48 57 1 1 1 1                                            12 fits in at beginning, circular property, (h=8, t=3) 25 37 48 57 1 1 1 12                                            92 fits in at end (t=4). 25 37 48 57 92 1 1 12                                            86 fits in middle, S=5, L=1, so shift 92 right, (t=5). 25 37 48 57 86 92 1 12                                            33 fits in middle, S=2, L=5, so shift 12, 25 left (h=7, t=5). 33 37 48 57 86 92 12 25 Input Specification The input will consist of a single line containing an integer N followed by the N integers to be sorted. All integers are positive and are separated by a single space. There will be no duplicates among the N integers. Output Specification The output should consist of N lines, each line containing N integers. The N integers are the contents of Y[] (ie. Y[0] to Y[N-1]) after the insertion of each integer from X[]. All integers on a line should be separated by a single space. N will be less than 50. Sample Input/Output Input 8 25 57 37 48 12 92 86 33 Output 25 -1  -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 25 57  -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 25 37  57 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 25 37  48 57 -1 -1 -1 -1 25 37  48 57 -1 -1 -1 12 25 37  48 57 92 -1 -1 12 25 37  48 57 86 92 -1 12 33 37  48 57 86 92 12 25

hash-table					The following is the design question I was asked.  Design a dash board.  Should be very realistic.  Should be scalabe .  Should have very less latency .  Can expect millions of updates per second. Dash board should show :  for each day :  1. city name ,  2.total trips in that city for that day ,  3.total fare it could collect in that city on that day,  4. fare collected from old clients  5. fare collected from new clients (new client is the client who is having his first ride in Uber after registration) Input : we get two strings s1 , s2.  the format of s1 : trip_id , client_id , city , datetime the format of s2 : trip_id , fare.  Could you please suggest how to proceed for this kind of question?

hash-table					Second round was intersting: that guy gave me a situation, like I have a file with columns product_id, qty, date, product_name.  I need to sort them based on qty that has been sold out on day. For example, this product has been sold highest on this day.

hash-table					Remove duplicates in an array of numbers. You can use a second array or the same array, as the output array. (I used a hash table to do this).

hash-table					there are numbers in between 0-9999999999 (10-digits) which are assigened someone (does not matter which number assigned who)  Write two methods called "getNumber" and "requestNumber" as follows Number getNumber(); boolean requestNumber(Number number);  getNumber method should find out a number that did not assigened than marks it as assiged and  return that number.  requestNumber method checks the number is assigened or not. If it is assigened returns false, else marks it as assiged and return true.  design a data sturucture to keep those numbers and implement those methods

hash-table					[Phone screen] Let's say I gave you a long String and I wanted you to tell me the most common word in that String.  How would you do that?    follow-up: OK, how would you estimate the size and time complexity of this solution?  How would you estimate the ACTUAL size usage?  (Hint: how many words are in the English language?  Would having a dictionary in front of you help?)  follow-up #2: OK, how about if I gave you the entire works of Alexandre Dumas, one of the most prolific authors in history.  How would your solution work?  How could you change it to solve this more specific problem?    follow-up #3: Now, what if we wanted to find the most common PHRASE in his writings.  (Upon clarification, the interviewer wouldn't give a specific length, so I clarified to finding as long as a common 10 word phrase, because anything longer is unlikely.)

hash-table					How to design a multi key hash map ( key count can be dynamic. if there are two keys , initiallly which can be used to find the value , keys can be increased to three as well ex: consider  school structure. Intially ,  consider , student id is key , later , should be searchable even with key name , later with grade.

hash-table					Design a telephone directory for large ppl (he gave example like design for India). fields will be , first name , last name , number . this should be searchable with first name , last name , number as welll. later added more complexity like do the same for organisation where even it contains designations. so this should be searchable with designations.

hash-table					How do you implement a HashTable? What data structures are used internally to implement this HashTable?

hash-table					Find the first non-repeating character in a stream of characters?

hash-table					Consider a hash table with M slots. Suppose hash value is uniformly distributed between 1 to M, and it uses linked list to handle conflicts (if two keys hashed to the same slot). Suppose we put N keys into this M-slotted hash table, what is the probability that there will be a slot with i elements? i could vary from 0 to N.

hash-table					Print the actual phone number when given an alphanumeric phone number. For e.g. an input of 1-800-COM-CAST should give output as 18002662278 (note: output also does not contain any special characters like "-").

hash-table					What should be the output of the following code.  class Test {    public int i=0; @Override public int hashCode() {     return i; } }  Class a{     psvm(){     HashMap <Test, String> hm = new HashMap();  Test t1 = new Test();  hm.put(t1,success);  sysout(hm.get(t1));  //print success  t1.i = 10;  sysout(hm.get(t1));  //NULL   } }

hash-table					Explain how hashtables work internally. How is hashcode generated and what wiill happen to hash code when 2 values are same.

hash-table					Given an array which contains the parent  of the ith element in the n-ary tree.Parent[i] = -1 for root. Find the height of the tree. Gave O(n2) ,space O(1). Expected Complexity- Linear You can use extra space if you want. Example- {-1 0 1 6 6 0 0 2 7}   0  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 is the root here. 0 is the parent of 1 5 6  1 is parnt of 2 6 is parent of 3 4  2 is of 7 which is parent of 8.

hash-table					Consider a hash table of size N, numbered 0 to N-1. You have to insert integers into this table using the hashing technique given below: Let i be the integer to be inserted. Compute the index j of the location where the insertion is to be made as j = i mod N. If this location is empty then put the element at this position else recompute the next location as follows: Remove the right most digit of i. Using the new value of i, recompute j = i mod N. If the digit removed was odd, then move j locations forward from the current location else move j locations backward from the current location (assume 0 as even). Note that this move will wrap around both the edges of the table. Keep doing this till you either find a free location or all the digits of i have been removed. When i comes to only one digit, and its rightmost digit is removed, the number remaining is zero - therefore, this will lead to a zero-step move. If all digits of i have been removed and yet unable to find a free location, from the last location tried, start moving in the direction corresponding to the last digit removed. Keep moving till you detect a free location. Assume that the number of integers inserted is not more than the table size. Input Specification The first line will contain just one integer. This will give the table size, N. On the next line will be the list of positive integers that need to be inserted into the table. The integers will be separated by a space each, and the last integer will be -1 indicating end of input. (-1 is not to be inserted into the table). Output Specification The output should contain, for each integer, the locations that were checked while inserting that integer (including the location in which the integer was finally inserted). The locations checked for each of the integers should be output on a line by itself, separated by one space each, each line being terminated by a new line. Sample Input/Output Input 7 38 52 145 16 179 4 -1 Output 3 3   5 5   5 4 2 4   0 4   4 3 2 1

threads					I have two methods of an object, and they each access a critical section of code. I want to restrict access to the section so that in one method, I allow multiple threads to access the critical section. In the other method, I want only one thread to have access. If a caller calls the second method, it should lock out all clients from accessing the critical section in either of the two functions. Here is the basic structure of the class:  class ClassThatNeedsFixing { public:         // Will allow many concurrent threads through, unless there is a         // call to the other method.         void AllowMany() {                 // Here is the critical section that must be protected                 ...         }          // Will lock out any client, including callers to the other method.         void AllowOne() {                 // Here is the critical section that must be protected                 ...         }  private:         // Assume there are members here that need protecting         // above.         ... }; In order to solve this problem, you are provided with two classes: Mutex and Semaphore. They have the standard behavior of the concepts that share their class names. Here are the public interfaces for each of these classes:  class Mutex { public:         Mutex();         void Acquire();         void Release(); }; class Semaphore { public:         // At it's creation, one can specify the count         // of the semaphore.         Semaphore(unsigned int count);                 void Acquire();                 void Release(); };  Fix the ClassThatNeedsFixing implementation so that the critical section is protected.  Your solution will be graded on flexibility and robustness (i.e., we should be able to re-use your solution in a generic case and it should be exception safe). You are allowed to create as many classes/objects/templates/etc that you need. Feel free to use the STL if necessary. Document your code as you would for real-world maintainability.

threads					what are threads and multi-threads?

threads					What is the difference between a process and a thread?

threads					A program has two functions 'reader_func' and 'writer_func'. The reader_func reads shared data and contains a critical section. The writer_func writes to shared data and contains a critical section.   Reader threads call reader_func. Writer threads call writer_func.   The condition is multiple reader threads can access the critical section at the same time as long as they don't access the critical section along with a writer. Only a single writer thread can access the critical section, i.e. no reader or other writer threads are allowed.   Give the code segment, add code that uses mutexes that controls access to the critical sections so that the shared data is not corrupted and satisfies the give conditions. You can create as many mutexes and global variables as you want. Don't emphasize too much on syntax as to how to acquire and release locks on mutexes. Just use mutex.acquire() and mutex.release() .

large-scale-computing					We tend to use computer to solve practical problems that actually earns or save dollars. Here is something that happens across the stock exchanges : people buy and sell stocks. We generally use automated intelligent systems to buy and sell stocks. That part is too much mathematics, and beyond scope of this interview. There is another part. Suppose the system issues a buy order : buy 1000 Microsoft stock. Now, there are more than 1 ( in fact 10 ) active exchanges from where we can buy MSFT.  There is a slight price delta, which keeps changing over time. There is another problem. In each stock exchange, prices are stacked, that is : 1. For first 100 stocks prices are 55$. 2. Next 200 stocks, prices are 55.2$. ... etc, and you got the idea. Even this stacks are changing over time.  Thus, here is the problem to solve. Design and implement a system such that one can buy  n stocks with minimal price. Also, in the same spirit, the same system should be able to sell n stocks with maximum payoff possible.  This is a non trivial problem, for Quant systems. There are always k no of exchanges to hit.

stacks					Implement a stack with O(1) push, pop, and min

stacks					Q: Do you know what is a stack? Explain A: Yes, explained LIFO push pop peek Q: In stack, Push and Pop are constant. What will you do if you want an operation which gives the min of the stack also in constant time? A: Question is straight out of Gayle's Book. You just maintain a new stack of minimum number till that point.

stacks					Find the minimum element in a stack in O(1) time complexity and O(n) space complexity

stacks					Reverse a stack without using extra stack (i.e. doing in place reversal). (hinted about using double recursion).

stacks					implement a stack which will support three additional operations in addition to push and pop: 1.peekLowestElement()//return the lowest element in the stack without removing it from the stack 2.peekHighestElement()//return the highset element in the stack without removing it from the stack 3.peekMiddleElement()//return the (size/2 +1)th lowest element in the stack without removing it from the stack.  faster is better.Assume every method will be called with equal frequency.

stacks					Implement enqueue and dequeue operations using stack(s).

puzzle					You're the guard of a prison, you want to keep an eye on the most dangerous prisoner. Each prisoner has a danger rank of his own and a group of friends (prisoners, who also have danger ranks). The guard has a list of prisoners with their corresponding danger ranks and he also has a list of the friends of each of the prisoners in the prison.  The danger rank is computed as follows: Prisoner 1 has a danger value of 5, his friends are Prisoner 2 and Prisoner 5, who have danger values of 3 and 4 respectively. So the danger value of Prisoner 1 is 5+3+4 = 12.  There could be any number of prisoners. Whichever prisoner has the highest value is the most dangerous(computed using the above method).  Friendship can be assumed to be symmetric.  Come up with an efficient algorithm to find the most dangerous prisoner?  The solution I came up with runs in quadratic time.  A hash table which has the Prisoner as Key and list of his friends as value Compute the sum of danger rank of all friends one key at a Time. (n * N) Maintain a max count and update it as necessary. I believe there is a solution for this problem having better time complexity than O(N^2).

python					Programming Challenge Description:  Develop a service to help a client quickly find a manager who can resolve the conflict between two employees. When there is a conflict between two employees, the closest common manager should help resolve the conflict. The developers plan to test the service by providing an example reporting hierarchy to enable the identification of the closest common manager for two employees. Your goal is to develop an algorithm for IBM to efficiently perform this task. To keep things simple, they just use a single relationship "isManagerOf" between any two employees. For example, consider a reporting structure represented as a set of triples:  Tom isManagerOf Mary Mary isManagerOf Bob Mary isManagerOf Sam Bob isManagerOf John Sam isManagerOf Pete Sam isManagerOf Katie  The manager who should resolve the conflict between Bob and Mary is Tom(Mary's manager). The manager who should resolve the conflict between Pete and Katie is Sam(both employees' manager). The manager who should resolve the conflict between Bob and Pete is Mary(Bob's manager and Pete's manager's manager).   Assumptions: There will be at least one isManagerOf relationship. There can be a maximum of 15 team member to a single manager No cross management would exist i.e., a person can have only one manager There can be a maximum of 100 levels of manager relationships in the corporation  Input:  R1,R2,R3,R4...Rn,Person1,Person2 R1...Rn - A comma separated list of "isManagerOf" relationships. Each relationship being represented by an arrow "Manager->Person". Person1,Person2 - The name of the two employee that have conflict Output:  The name of the manager who can resolve the conflict Note: Please be prepared to provide a video follow-up response to describe your approach to this exercise.  Test 1: Test Input  Frank->Mary,Mary->Sam,Mary->Bob,Sam->Katie,Sam->Pete,Bob->John,Bob,Katie   Expected Output  Mary   Test 2: Test Input  Sam->Pete,Pete->Nancy,Sam->Katie,Mary->Bob,Frank->Mary,Mary->Sam,Bob->John,Sam,John  Expected Output  Mary

python					The SHIELD is a secretive organization entrusted with the task of guarding the world against any disaster. Their arch nemesis is the organization called HYDRA. Unfortunately some members from HYDRA had infiltrated into the SHIELD camp. SHIELD needed to find out all these infiltrators to ensure  that it was not compromised.  Nick Fury, the executive director and the prime SHIELD member figured out that every one in SHIELD could send a SOS signal to every other SHIELD member he knew well. The HYDRA members could send bogus SOS messages  to others to confuse others, but they could never receive a SOS message from a SHIELD member. Every SHIELD member would receive a SOS message ateast one other SHIELD member, who in turn would have received from another SHIELD member and so on till NickFury. SHIELD had a sophisticated mechanism to  capture who sent a SOS signal to whom. Given this information, Nick needed someone to write a program that could look into this data and figure out all HYDRA members.  Sample Input Nick Fury : Tony Stark, Maria Hill, Norman Osborn Hulk : Tony Stark, HawkEye, Rogers Rogers : Thor,  Tony Stark: Pepper Potts, Nick Fury Agent 13 : Agent-X, Nick Fury, Hitler Thor: HawkEye, BlackWidow BlackWidow:Hawkeye Maria Hill : Hulk, Rogers, Nick Fury Agent-X : Agent 13, Rogers Norman Osborn: Tony Stark, Thor  Sample Output Agent 13, Agent-X, Hitler   You can code in any language of your choice.

python					McDonalds sells Chicken McNuggets in packages of 6, 9 or 20 McNuggets. Thus, it is possible, for example, to buy exactly 15 McNuggets (with one package of 6 and a second package of 9), but it is not possible to buy exactly 16 McNuggets, since no non- negative integer combination of 6's, 9's and 20's add up to 16. To determine if it is possible to buy exactly n McNuggets, one has to find non-negative integer values of a, b, and c such that 6a+9b+20c=n Write a function, called McNuggets that takes one argument, n, and returns True if it is possible to buy a combination of 6, 9 and 20 pack units such that the total number of McNuggets equals n, and otherwise returns False. Hint: use a guess and check approach.
