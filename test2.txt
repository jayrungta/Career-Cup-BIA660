algorithm	0	Delhi Route Traffic Optimizer  Traffic congestion is an annoying issue in Delhi, the capital of India. Every morning thousands of people drivea residential area to the International Technology Park (ITPL). There are various routes one can take to reach ITPL and each route takes its own time making some routes faster than the others. People obviously take faster routes which causes congestion on those roads too. Congestion results into increased travel time, air pollution and wastage of fuel. As a Traffic commissioner of Delhi, you are asked to optimize the traffic by putting toll to various roads so that resultant cost of every route (driving time cost and toll cost) ends up the same. This has to be done in such a way that any driver pays toll only once no matter which route he/she takes.roads have one-way traffic and there is no cycle in any of the routes. You need to create a toll plan for a given road layout.   The toll plan must adhere to following rules:  1. Toll should be levied in such a way that perceived cost (base road cost and toll cost) remains same forroads. 2. The tolls should be levied such that the total cost for each route is minimized. 3. A route cannot have more than one toll. 4. In case of multiple solutions for a route, add toll to a road that is closer to destination.  In some use cases, it might be impossible to impose tolls that satisfy the above conditions.  http://qa.geeksforgeeks.org/11340/delhi-route-traffic-optimizer

algorithm	0	You have a range of consecutive numbers, from 1 to n (inclusive). e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4... n]. We would like to calculate a sum of a function across the entire range, where the function returns the product of the preceding C elements.  If there are less than C previous elements, just use the available numbers. i.e. if you are processing the fourth number in the range, but C is greater than 3, then you will calculate the product using only the 3 available preceding numbers. In this situation as you move further along in this range more preceding numbers become available.  A worked example follows: if n=5 and C=2, the correct products and final sum for each element of the range are: 0 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 12 = 21  Can you explain this question and complexity of your algorithm?
algorithm	0	Cross the River  Saatwik, an elite programmer love the woods. Once he was in one of his trips to the mighty Himalayas , he encountered a strange problem. As we all know that, Himalayas has abundant river streams and forests. While travelling in one of the forest, he was trapped by the river stream flowing. As the stream flow was fast, he couldn't cross by swimming across water, he must find some other way to cross it.  River is present throughout the X axis and its boundary is marked by y coordinates (i.e. from y=A to y=B) .  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (y=A) ..................................................................................................  ..................................................................................................  ..................................................................................................  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (y=B)  Now, You are provided with some rocks along with their centres and radius respectively. Currently Saatwik is present on the shore having y=B . We can't jump between the rocks but we can move from one rock to other if both overlap at some points. You need to tell whether Saatwik will be able to cross the river by using any number of rocks or not . If he can, then output the minimum number of rocks taken to achieve it otherwise output 1   Input :  First line of input will contain T denoting number of test cases. For each of the test cases, First line will contain N denoting number of rocks. From second line onward, there will be N lines containing 3 integers X,Y,R where (X,Y) denotes the coordinates of the centre of that rocks and R stands for its radius. Last line will contain two integers A and B denoting the upper and lower boundary of the river respectively.  Output:  Output the required answer in a separate line for each of the test case.

algorithm	0	The King's Land Sale - 2 You might have seen shopkeepers offering sale on their trade items to promote their business - like sale on electronic gadgets or sale on clothing and accessories etc. But have you ever come across something like sale of land ?  Yes, the king of Byteland has grown old and wants to sell away his territory as soon as possible. So he announced a sale on his plot. This drew attention of many land lords and everybody hurried to buy land at the cheapest prices. The king had declared that he would accept bids of only rectangular plots and one needs to mention the diagonally opposite corners(a, b) and (c, d) of the land he wishes to buy. They would write these 4 numbers (a, b, c, d) on a piece of paper, seal it in an airtight envelope and give it to the king.  The king received N such envelopes. As the process was hidden there were many envelopes containing plot descriptions that shared some (or even all) common area. The king now wants to know the union of the areas of all plots that have come under the bidding.  Note that the rectangles made by the plots are always aligned to the rectangular axes, their areas is always positive and c >= a and d >= b.  Note that the rectangles made by the plots are always aligned to the rectangular axes, their areas is always positive and c >= a and d >= b.  Constraints  1  T  20  1  N  20  -10000  a, b, c, d  10000  Input  The first line of the input contains the number of test cases T. The description of T test cases follow. Each test case starts with a line containing an integer N, the number of rectangular plots. Then N lines follow, each with 4 space separated integers, a b c d,(a, b) and (c, d) representing the diagonally opposite corners of the plots.  Output  For each test case print one line, the union of the areas of all the plots.    Explanation  1) The individual areas of both plots are 4 each. But they share a common area of 1 between them (between (1, 1) and (2, 2)). Therefore the total area is 4 + 4 - 1 = 7  2)Both the plots of no area in common. So we simply add their individual areas (6 + 9 = 15).

Maga is at the left-top and wants to go to right-bottom. But there is a condition. Maga can go through only two way - right and down. And the path of your move is called the nodes you have passed through over them. The path is called the most beautiful if the following condition is satisfied: The sorted of the path has to be lexicographic smallest as possible as. Output the most beautiful path for given grid.  Input: In the first line you are given two numbers: the dimensions of grid - n and m. The next n lines contains m numbers. Each number is unique.  Output: Output the most beautiful path.  Contraints: 1 <= n,m <= 1000 1 <= A[i][j] <= n*m, All of the numbers in the grid are unique.   Sample Input 2 2 4 2 3 1  Sample Output 1 2 4  Explanation There are 2 ways to reach at (2,2) cell. The pathes are 4, 3, 1 or 4, 2, 1 respectively. So The most beautiful of them is 4, 2, 1 because if looking the sorted of them it looks like these : 1, 3, 4 and 1, 2, 4 respectively. So 1, 2, 4 is lexicographic smaller than the other. So the ans is 1 2 4.

Cell values are either a number (long or double) or an expression containing numbers, operators, and references to other cells (i.e. B2 means the second column [B] and second row [2]).  You can ignore the parsing of expressions for this exercise.  Instead, your solution can define the data you will work with after expressions have been parsed.  Cycles  A cycle occurs when a cell refers to itself either directly or indirectly via an expression.

algorithm	1	We know a string is Palindrome if it is the same reading from both sides. Now we define the following string also Palindrome:  A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!  Write a code that returns if an string is palindrome and  it should return true for above input. (Without directly saying, I should conclude that I have to only consider alphanumerical characters in a string). In addition, we assume the string is very long and we can not keep a copy of this string or even a copy of preprocessed version of this string. Therefore the result should be returned with the first sweep of the string.
algorithm	0	Given array of marks and array of time taken to finish the question, and a passing mark P maximize on marks which will get you P but minimizing the time t.   I tried to solve this by dividing the marks by time which will give factor of utilization of a particular question, and then partition the marks on P, and choose only marks less than P, try to sort the selected marks, time pair in small subset, and minimize on t. Is this a right approach.

algorithm	0	The person who wrote this problem is going through the bad phase of his life. But, fortunately he won some cash in his last programming event. Now to make his girlfriend feel special, he wants to buy her some chocolates. As mentioned, he is not having good time so he want to spend as less as possible. Keeping that in mind, he decided to play a game with her. The rule of game is as follows: 1) There are N chocolates represented by type 1..N 2) He will arrange them in a row in some random order 3) Now she (his girlfriend ofcourse) has to pick an index say i, then she will get all the chocolates at index j such that j>i and type of chocolate at j is strictly less than type of chocolate at index i.  He believes that his girlfriend is not that clever and will surely not choose the most optimal index, but he wants to know that if by any chance she picked the optimal index then how many chocolates will he have to buy.  Input: First line contain N. then next line contain N space separated integers.  output : A single integer which is the answer.  Constraints : 1  N  105  1<=A[i]<=10^5 Sample Input (Plaintext Link)  10 7 6 10 5 2 8 1 9 3 4   Sample Output (Plaintext Link)  7  Explanation If she chooses i=3, then all the elements in right of i have type less than 10, hence ans is 7. In none of the other case she can get more chocolates.

data-structures	8	Q: If you have all the companies that are traded, and live inputs are coming of which company is being traded and what is the volume, how do you maintain the data, so that you can carry out operation of giving the top 10 most traded companies by volume of shares most efficiently. A: I juggled between Hash Map and Max Heap. I said Max Heap, since I can take out top 10 companies in a jiffy with a Max Heap. But then he asked you will need to find a company everytime there is a trade, which will take quite some time in Heap. He pointed out that in real world scenario, number of trades happening, and hence searching of the company and updating it, will be many times more than finding top 10. Which bought me to HashMap. Updations can happen in Real time, while finding top 10 can be done in O(n) or O(nlog(n)) time. Even that wasn't optimal obviously. The interviewer was very nice and friendly type guy. He stressed that at every trade, at most, only 1 company will change in my top 10. This hit me and got me to the correct answer that we keep all actual data in HashMap, but also maintain a MinHeap of 10 most traded company.

Now read the file and we need to determine the order of execution of function depending on the input parameter list  we can't execute f1 first because we have only parameters a , b and d f2 can be executed because we have a, b and d parameters, which gives parameter c now f3 can be executed because we have parameters a and c.. so we need to find the order and execute functions as quickly as possible (can use multi threading) so efficient order is  f2 and f4 can run parallel and then f1 and f3 can be started only after completion of f2.

coding	0	You are given a rectangular grid with 2 rows and N columns. The top row is labeled 1 and the bottom row is labeled 2. The columns are labeled from 1 to N in increasing order. Each cell in the grid contains a single character. Consider a hamiltonian walk in this grid. Meaning, pick a starting cell, say (i,j), and consider a path that starts from (i,j) and goes through every cell in the grid exactly once. Note that you can only walk to adjacent cells, or cells that you share a common edge with. There may be several such paths. Let us concatenate the characters in the order in which the cells are visited during a walk. The string formed can be called the string for the walk. Among all the possible walks, and their respective strings, find out the lexicographically smallest string. We know that the length of the strings are all the same - to be precise, 2N. Thus, the lexicographically smallest string is simply the alphabetically smallest string if you compare the characters from left to right. Input  The first line of input contains a number T, the number of test cases. Then follow T test cases. Each test case contains 3 lines. The first line contains the number N, the number of columns in the grid. It is well known of course that the grid contains 2 rows. The next two lines contain the description of the grid in the form of two strings; the string of N characters in row 1 from left to right and the string of N characters in row 2 from left to right, respectively.

arrays	0	You are given a string S consisting of N brackets, opening "("  and/or closing ")". The goal is to split S into two parts (left and  right), such that the number of opening brackets in the left part is  equal to the number of closing brackets in the right part. For example, given S = "(())", the function should return 2,  because:  the first two characters of S, "((", contain two  opening brackets, and  the remaining two characters of S, "))", contain  two closing brackets.  In other example, given S = "(())))(", the function should return  4, because:  the first four characters of S, "(())", contain two  opening brackets, and  the remaining three characters of S, "))(", contain  two closing brackets.  In other example, given S = "))", the function should return 2,  because:  the first two characters of S, "))", contain zero  opening brackets, and  there are no remaining characters, so they contain  also zero closing brackets.

java	4	Had my first and second phone interview with Amazon. I was dropped. This site has been a great help towards my preparation and most questions are based on what you find here. Posting my Questions is a small way of saying Thanks!  Interview 1: 1. What is polymorphism. 2. Design an OO parking lot. What classes and functions will it have. It should say, full, empty and also be able to find spot for Valet parking. The lot has 3 different types of parking: regular, handicapped and compact. 3. Coding: I have an integer array where every number appears even number of times and only one appears odd times. Find the number. (I said hashtable and he asked me to write code with Hashtable) 4. What data structure would you use to look up phone numbers for customer names. (I said Hashtable. Asked why hashtable, why not a tree. I said HT has O(1). Asked is order always 1, when more than O(1) in HT.   Second Interview: 1. Starter: Describe your college projects. 2. OO Design: Design a deck of cards. What classes, data structures will you use? How will you shuffle the cards? How will you divide (deck) among players. What class/function do you need to denote players and where will you add them? What class/function do you need to deck? What if I need to add 2 jokers to the deck of 52 cards.  3. Data Structures: How will you use a hashtable to find data in a tree. (Then he rephrased) suppose I have a hashtable, I want to store the data in a tree instead of a bucket. How will I do it. What complexity to find an element.  4. Bits & Bytes: Find if a binary representation of a number is palindrome. The function should work irrespective of number of bytes for an integer. Suppose if our machine is 4 bytes for an int, how will you use the program for 8 byte machine.  5. Unix: Suppose I have 100's of html files in many directories. I want to find the files having phone numbers.   b) Suppose I have 2 files having phone numbers, find the repeating phone numbers. (I said sort and grep). Then he asked what if the lines cannot be sorted.   All the best guys. I think the second interview was challenging since the interviewer was prodding until he heard a leave me alone. So it means that though they are based on questions in cc, be prepared for extensions. I think this site is all you need to prepare for Amazon interview.

string-manipulation	1	Programming Challenge Description:  Develop a service to help a client quickly find a manager who can resolve the conflict between two employees. When there is a conflict between two employees, the closest common manager should help resolve the conflict. The developers plan to test the service by providing an example reporting hierarchy to enable the identification of the closest common manager for two employees. Your goal is to develop an algorithm for IBM to efficiently perform this task. To keep things simple, they just use a single relationship "isManagerOf" between any two employees. For example, consider a reporting structure represented as a set of triples:  Tom isManagerOf Mary Mary isManagerOf Bob Mary isManagerOf Sam Bob isManagerOf John Sam isManagerOf Pete Sam isManagerOf Katie  The manager who should resolve the conflict between Bob and Mary is Tom(Mary's manager). The manager who should resolve the conflict between Pete and Katie is Sam(both employees' manager). The manager who should resolve the conflict between Bob and Pete is Mary(Bob's manager and Pete's manager's manager).   Assumptions: There will be at least one isManagerOf relationship. There can be a maximum of 15 team member to a single manager No cross management would exist i.e., a person can have only one manager There can be a maximum of 100 levels of manager relationships in the corporation  Input:  R1,R2,R3,R4...Rn,Person1,Person2 R1...Rn - A comma separated list of "isManagerOf" relationships. Each relationship being represented by an arrow "Manager->Person". Person1,Person2 - The name of the two employee that have conflict Output:  The name of the manager who can resolve the conflict Note: Please be prepared to provide a video follow-up response to describe your approach to this exercise.  Test 1: Test Input  Frank->Mary,Mary->Sam,Mary->Bob,Sam->Katie,Sam->Pete,Bob->John,Bob,Katie   Expected Output  Mary   Test 2: Test Input  Sam->Pete,Pete->Nancy,Sam->Katie,Mary->Bob,Frank->Mary,Mary->Sam,Bob->John,Sam,John  Expected Output  Mary

problem-solving	0	You're the guard of a prison, you want to keep an eye on the most dangerous prisoner. Each prisoner has a danger rank of his own and a group of friends (prisoners, who also have danger ranks). The guard has a list of prisoners with their corresponding danger ranks and he also has a list of the friends of each of the prisoners in the prison.  The danger rank is computed as follows: Prisoner 1 has a danger value of 5, his friends are Prisoner 2 and Prisoner 5, who have danger values of 3 and 4 respectively. So the danger value of Prisoner 1 is 5+3+4 = 12.  There could be any number of prisoners. Whichever prisoner has the highest value is the most dangerous(computed using the above method).  Friendship can be assumed to be symmetric.  Come up with an efficient algorithm to find the most dangerous prisoner?  The solution I came up with runs in quadratic time.  A hash table which has the Prisoner as Key and list of his friends as value Compute the sum of danger rank of all friends one key at a Time. (n * N) Maintain a max count and update it as necessary. I believe there is a solution for this problem having better time complexity than O(N^2).

threads	0	asked simple question about context switching, advantage/disadvantage of process vs thread etc
threads	0	I have two methods of an object, and they each access a critical section of code. I want to restrict access to the section so that in one method, I allow multiple threads to access the critical section. In the other method, I want only one thread to have access. If a caller calls the second method, it should lock out all clients from accessing the critical section in either of the two functions. Here is the basic structure of the class:  class ClassThatNeedsFixing { public:         // Will allow many concurrent threads through, unless there is a         // call to the other method.         void AllowMany() {                 // Here is the critical section that must be protected                 ...         }          // Will lock out any client, including callers to the other method.         void AllowOne() {                 // Here is the critical section that must be protected                 ...         }  private:         // Assume there are members here that need protecting         // above.         ... }; In order to solve this problem, you are provided with two classes: Mutex and Semaphore. They have the standard behavior of the concepts that share their class names. Here are the public interfaces for each of these classes:  class Mutex { public:         Mutex();         void Acquire();         void Release(); }; class Semaphore { public:         // At it's creation, one can specify the count         // of the semaphore.         Semaphore(unsigned int count);                 void Acquire();                 void Release(); };  Fix the ClassThatNeedsFixing implementation so that the critical section is protected.  Your solution will be graded on flexibility and robustness (i.e., we should be able to re-use your solution in a generic case and it should be exception safe). You are allowed to create as many classes/objects/templates/etc that you need. Feel free to use the STL if necessary. Document your code as you would for real-world maintainability.
