algorithm	4	# There's a room with a TV and people are coming in and out to watch it. The TV is on only when there's at least a person in the room. # For each person that comes in, we record the start and end time. We want to know for how long the TV has been on. In other words: # Given a list of arrays of time intervals, write a function that calculates the total amount of time covered by the intervals. # For example: # input = [(1,4), (2,3)] # > 3 # input = [(4,6), (1,2)] # > 3 # input = {{1,4}, {6,8}, {2,4}, {7,9}, {10, 15}} # > 11
algorithm	4	Q: If you were given a series of equations e.g. [A = B, B = D, C = D, F = G, E = H, H = C] and then another series [A != C, D != H, ..., F != A ] Check whether the equations combined is valid. For the example given, your program should return 'invalid', because the first series implies that A = C, which contradicts the statement A != C in the second series.

algorithm	0	Running with Bunnies ==================== You and your rescued bunny prisoners need to get out of this collapsing death trap of a space station - and fast! Unfortunately, some of the bunnies have been weakened by their long imprisonment and can't run very fast. Their friends are trying to help them, but this escape would go a lot faster if you also pitched in. The defensive bulkhead doors have begun to close, and if you don't make it through in time, you'll be trapped! You need to grab as many bunnies as you can and get through the bulkheads before they close. The time it takes to move from your starting point to all of the bunnies and to the bulkhead will be given to you in a square matrix of integers. Each row will tell you the time it takes to get to the start, first bunny, second bunny, ..., last bunny, and the bulkhead in that order. The order of the rows follows the same pattern (start, each bunny, bulkhead). The bunnies can jump into your arms, so picking them up is instantaneous, and arriving at the bulkhead at the same time as it seals still allows for a successful, if dramatic, escape. (Don't worry, any bunnies you don't pick up will be able to escape with you since they no longer have to carry the ones you did pick up.) You can revisit different spots if you wish, and moving to the bulkhead doesn't mean you have to immediately leave - you can move to and from the bulkhead to pick up additional bunnies if time permits. In addition to spending time traveling between bunnies, some paths interact with the space station's security checkpoints and add time back to the clock. Adding time to the clock will delay the closing of the bulkhead doors, and if the time goes back up to 0 or a positive number after the doors have already closed, it triggers the bulkhead to reopen. Therefore, it might be possible to walk in a circle and keep gaining time: that is, each time a path is traversed, the same amount of time is used or added. Write a function of the form answer(times, time_limit) to calculate the most bunnies you can pick up and which bunnies they are, while still escaping through the bulkhead before the doors close for good. If there are multiple sets of bunnies of the same size, return the set of bunnies with the lowest prisoner IDs (as indexes) in sorted order. The bunnies are represented as a sorted list by prisoner ID, with the first bunny being 0. There are at most 5 bunnies, and time_limit is a non-negative integer that is at most 999. For instance, in the case of [ [0, 2, 2, 2, -1], # 0 = Start [9, 0, 2, 2, -1], # 1 = Bunny 0 [9, 3, 0, 2, -1], # 2 = Bunny 1 [9, 3, 2, 0, -1], # 3 = Bunny 2 [9, 3, 2, 2, 0], # 4 = Bulkhead ] and a time limit of 1, the five inner array rows designate the starting point, bunny 0, bunny 1, bunny 2, and the bulkhead door exit respectively. You could take the path: Start End Delta Time Status - 0 - 1 Bulkhead initially open 0 4 -1 2 4 2 2 0 2 4 -1 1 4 3 2 -1 Bulkhead closes 3 4 -1 0 Bulkhead reopens; you and the bunnies exit With this solution, you would pick up bunnies 1 and 2. This is the best combination for this space station hallway, so the answer is [1, 2]. Test cases ========== Inputs: (int) times = [[0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]] (int) time_limit = 3 Output: (int list) [0, 1] Inputs: (int) times = [[0, 2, 2, 2, -1], [9, 0, 2, 2, -1], [9, 3, 0, 2, -1], [9, 3, 2, 0, -1], [9, 3, 2, 2, 0]] (int) time_limit = 1 Output: (int list) [1, 2]

algorithm	0	We tend to use computer to solve practical problems that actually earns or save dollars. Here is something that happens across the stock exchanges : people buy and sell stocks. We generally use automated intelligent systems to buy and sell stocks. That part is too much mathematics, and beyond scope of this interview. There is another part. Suppose the system issues a buy order : buy 1000 Microsoft stock. Now, there are more than 1 ( in fact 10 ) active exchanges from where we can buy MSFT. There is a slight price delta, which keeps changing over time. There is another problem. In each stock exchange, prices are stacked, that is : 1. For first 100 stocks prices are 55$. 2. Next 200 stocks, prices are 55.2$. ... etc, and you got the idea. Even this stacks are changing over time. Thus, here is the problem to solve. Design and implement a system such that one can buy n stocks with minimal price. Also, in the same spirit, the same system should be able to sell n stocks with maximum payoff possible. This is a non trivial problem, for Quant systems. There are always k no of exchanges to hit.

algorithm	0	t's laundry day, and, as usual, you've been putting this off for quite some time. Also, unfortunately, you lacked the foresight to actually ensure all your dirty laundry stayed in your hamper whilst it accumulated (what? we can't ALL be underwear basketball pros!). Begrudgingly, you've gathered up all the clothing you could find and sent them through the wash. Now you have a disheveled pile of clean, albiet disorganized, accoutrements. You come to the realization that you probably lost some items in the fray, so now it's time to fold and figure out what's gone missing! To get a good idea of the state of your wardrobe, count up the number of distinct shirts, pants, and underwear you have as you go through the laundry. Also pair up your socks, noting the number of pairs of each kind of sock and if there are any lonely souls (single (and ready to mingle) socks). Input Specifications Each article of clothing will have its own separate line. You have a penchant for hoarding, so there is no guarantee as to the number of pieces, but you can assure yourself that each article can be easily categorized by description (name). Articles of clothing will be fed in as line-delimited list. See below for examples. Output Specifications Output should be an alphabetically (case-insensitive) sorted, line-delimited list of the articles of clothing along with their count. Each field (count, category) should be separated by a pipe (|). If you come across a sock without a soulmate, the count should be designated by a 0 (zero). Socks that are in pairs should be on separate lines from the socks of the same category without pairs, and should come before the pairless sock. See below for examples. Sample Input/Output INPUT white shirt polka dot sock red sock superhero shirt torn jeans polka dot sock white shirt polka dot sock OUTPUT 1|polka dot sock 0|polka dot sock 0|red sock 1|superhero shirt 1|torn jeans 2|white shirt EXPLANATION As described above in the input and output specifications.

coding	0	You are given a rectangular grid with 2 rows and N columns. The top row is labeled 1 and the bottom row is labeled 2. The columns are labeled from 1 to N in increasing order. Each cell in the grid contains a single character. Consider a hamiltonian walk in this grid. Meaning, pick a starting cell, say (i,j), and consider a path that starts from (i,j) and goes through every cell in the grid exactly once. Note that you can only walk to adjacent cells, or cells that you share a common edge with. There may be several such paths. Let us concatenate the characters in the order in which the cells are visited during a walk. The string formed can be called the string for the walk. Among all the possible walks, and their respective strings, find out the lexicographically smallest string. We know that the length of the strings are all the same - to be precise, 2N. Thus, the lexicographically smallest string is simply the alphabetically smallest string if you compare the characters from left to right. Input The first line of input contains a number T, the number of test cases. Then follow T test cases. Each test case contains 3 lines. The first line contains the number N, the number of columns in the grid. It is well known of course that the grid contains 2 rows. The next two lines contain the description of the grid in the form of two strings; the string of N characters in row 1 from left to right and the string of N characters in row 2 from left to right, respectively. Each character will be a lowercase engish letter. Output Output a single line for each test case. The line must contain a string with 2N characters. This string should be the lexicographically smallest string for some hamiltonian walk in the grid. Constraints 1 = T = 100 1 = N = 10 Sample Input 2 3 abc def 10 ababaaabab bababababa Sample Output abcfed aaababababababababab Explanation In the first test the possible strings are { abcfed, adebcf, adefcb, badefc, bcfeda, cbadef, cfedab, cfebad, dabcfe, dabefc, defcba, edabcf, efcbad, fedabc, fcbade, fcbeda }.

coding	0	Onsite Interview -- Directions 1) Write compiling (& working) code on linux 2) 2 hours. 3) Total questions 6 Mandatory 4(but 3 oky) Q2) Write a simple buffer class that provides a fixed length of unsigned char. While you should not use the STL to implement the class the class should be written in such a way that it can be used in an STL collection (i.e std::list<Buffer> should work). Instances of Buffer should be allowed to be instantiated with an initial buffer size. Provide a reqize(size_t) method that will shrink or grow the buffer. Provide access to individual elements of the buffer (i.e the ability to get/set the nth element of the buffer)

There are n students in the class and each student is identified by his/her student ID, which is between 1 and n. The coach has to select K players out of these n students for his team. But there is a twist, if among the K dodgeball players, a player's ID number evenly divides another player's ID number, then there is a high chance of them getting into a fight. The coach will do his best to select the K players so that no pair of players among them will want to fight one another. But if the game turns out to be very popular, this becomes impossible. Complete the function dodgeBall to return the minimum size of K at which it becomes impossible to choose a dodgeball team that has no fighting? Input Format: One line of text, containing the size of the class of 2013, n Constraints: 1 <= n <= 5,000,000,000 n is guaranteed to be an even number Output Format: The minimum size of K that guarantees the existence of 2 players who fight with each other in any K-sized subset of the class. Sample Input: 4 Sample Output: 3 Explanation: If the team = {1,2,3}: 1&2 or 1&3 can fight with each other If the team = {1,3,4}: 1&3 or 1&4 can fight with each other If the team = {2,3,4}: 2&4 can fight with each other If K=2, then the teams {3,4} or {2,3} will have no fights. So 3 is the smallest value of K for which any K-sized team, must include a fighting pair. Sample Input: 2 Sample Output: 2 Explanation: The team = {1,2}: 1&2 can fight with each other

Unfortunately some members from HYDRA had infiltrated into the SHIELD camp. SHIELD needed to find out all these infiltrators to ensure that it was not compromised. Nick Fury, the executive director and the prime SHIELD member figured out that every one in SHIELD could send a SOS signal to every other SHIELD member he knew well. The HYDRA members could send bogus SOS messages to others to confuse others, but they could never receive a SOS message from a SHIELD member. Every SHIELD member would receive a SOS message ateast one other SHIELD member, who in turn would have received from another SHIELD member and so on till NickFury. SHIELD had a sophisticated mechanism to capture who sent a SOS signal to whom. Given this information, Nick needed someone to write a program that could look into this data and figure out all HYDRA members. Sample Input Nick Fury : Tony Stark, Maria Hill, Norman Osborn Hulk : Tony Stark, HawkEye, Rogers Rogers : Thor, Tony Stark: Pepper Potts, Nick Fury Agent 13 : Agent-X, Nick Fury, Hitler Thor: HawkEye, BlackWidow BlackWidow:Hawkeye Maria Hill : Hulk, Rogers, Nick Fury Agent-X : Agent 13, Rogers Norman Osborn: Tony Stark, Thor Sample Output Agent 13, Agent-X, Hitler You can code in any language of your choice.

Unfortunately some members from HYDRA had infiltrated into the SHIELD camp. SHIELD needed to find out all these infiltrators to ensure that it was not compromised. Nick Fury, the executive director and the prime SHIELD member figured out that every one in SHIELD could send a SOS signal to every other SHIELD member he knew well. The HYDRA members could send bogus SOS messages to others to confuse others, but they could never receive a SOS message from a SHIELD member. Every SHIELD member would receive a SOS message ateast one other SHIELD member, who in turn would have received from another SHIELD member and so on till NickFury. SHIELD had a sophisticated mechanism to capture who sent a SOS signal to whom. Given this information, Nick needed someone to write a program that could look into this data and figure out all HYDRA members. Sample Input Nick Fury : Tony Stark, Maria Hill, Norman Osborn Hulk : Tony Stark, HawkEye, Rogers Rogers : Thor, Tony Stark: Pepper Potts, Nick Fury Agent 13 : Agent-X, Nick Fury, Hitler Thor: HawkEye, BlackWidow BlackWidow:Hawkeye Maria Hill : Hulk, Rogers, Nick Fury Agent-X : Agent 13, Rogers Norman Osborn: Tony Stark, Thor Sample Output Agent 13, Agent-X, Hitler You can code in any language of your choice.

brain-teasers	1	You stand in one corner of a large room, and your assistant is in its opposite corner. In front of the assistant is a 4-corner table, with a coin in each of the 4 corners. Your objective is to get the coins to be all heads or all tails. When that happens, the coins start jumping up and down; so, you'll know for sure when it happens. What you can do is to tell your assistant: (a) flip one coin; (b) flip two coins on a side of the table; (c) flip two coins on a diagonal of the table. You can't tell the assistant which coin, which side, or which diagonal to use. You can either think of your assistant as being extremely dumb, or that the table is being constantly rotated by external forces. What is the sequence of commands that you should give to your assistant to make sure the coins start jumping up and down?

trees-and-graphs	0	Round 2: Q2: Given a tree, in addition to the left and right pointer, it has a third pointer, that is set to NULL. Set the third pointer to a node, which will be the successor of the current node, when the tree is traversed in the zig-zag order. In other words, if we traverse the tree using this third pointer alone, then we will be traversing the tree in the zig-zag order. Input: (Plz construct the tree using the pre-order and in-order traversals) Pre-order: 1 2 4 5 3 6 7 In-order: 4 2 5 1 6 3 7 So, after the pointer is fixed, the traversal of the tree using the third pointer should give, 1 3 2 4 5 6 7

A block which stores the end of a file points to null. Also a block whose unused bit is 0 doesnt point to anything and is not pointed to by any block.Now u have an index of files with filename as index and the value as the first block in which the file starts.Lets says u somehow lose these indices and values.

problem-solving	0	You have a guy who is walking on a street with "X" doors on one side (say left side).From the third round, He has to walk "X" rounds to and fro( from point A, starting point to B, ending point). So he walks "X" times from A to B, and back "X" times. First two rounds he just walks to and fro. Every time he walks he closes the particular doors corresponding to the number of the round of his walk, starting from the third round. So at the third round, he closes the third door, sixth door, ninth door, .... upto "X", if "X" is a multiple of 3, "X-1", if "X-1" is a multiple of 3 AND "X-2", if "X-2" is a multiple of 3 Then he walks till the "X" door. This he does for every round, till the "Xth" round. So, if X is 300, he walks upto the 300th door, closes the 300th door and returns. If X is 400, he closes upto 399th door, goes till the 400th door and returns. If X is 500, he closes upto 498th door, goes till the 500th door and returns. While returning, he just does nothing. He just returns to where he started i.e. POINT A. Likewise for the fourth round, where he close doors that are multiples of 4 i.e. 4, 8, 12, 16, etc till X (Similar calc as in the 3rd round, except that we consider multiples of 4 here). And so on till the "Xth" round. I.E. This continiues till "X" rounds. So, from 3 to X rounds. Note that we have not included 1st and 2nd rounds. Problem here is: Write the code in any language of your choice to find: What is the minimum number of the round where he would not have to close any door?

hash-table	1	Given multiple strings like "candy", "carry", "dummy", etc. These strings are stored as c3y, c3y and d3y etc. Write a function which returns a boolean if the string (like "carry" is unique in the dictionary) bool isUniqueDictionaryWord(char *str) If the strings are in a file and you load it when the program loads, how will you store it ?
hash-table	0	Consider a hash table of size N, numbered 0 to N-1. You have to insert integers into this table using the hashing technique given below: Let i be the integer to be inserted. Compute the index j of the location where the insertion is to be made as j = i mod N. If this location is empty then put the element at this position else recompute the next location as follows: Remove the right most digit of i. Using the new value of i, recompute j = i mod N. If the digit removed was odd, then move j locations forward from the current location else move j locations backward from the current location (assume 0 as even). Note that this move will wrap around both the edges of the table. Keep doing this till you either find a free location or all the digits of i have been removed. When i comes to only one digit, and its rightmost digit is removed, the number remaining is zero - therefore, this will lead to a zero-step move. If all digits of i have been removed and yet unable to find a free location, from the last location tried, start moving in the direction corresponding to the last digit removed. Keep moving till you detect a free location. Assume that the number of integers inserted is not more than the table size. Input Specification The first line will contain just one integer. This will give the table size, N. On the next line will be the list of positive integers that need to be inserted into the table. The integers will be separated by a space each, and the last integer will be -1 indicating end of input. (-1 is not to be inserted into the table). Output Specification The output should contain, for each integer, the locations that were checked while inserting that integer (including the location in which the integer was finally inserted). The locations checked for each of the integers should be output on a line by itself, separated by one space each, each line being terminated by a new line. Sample Input/Output Input 7 38 52 145 16 179 4 -1 Output 3 3 5 5 5 4 2 4 0 4 4 3 2 1
