algorithm	0	Write an algorithm to create tables of a given set of players (i.e divide the players into groups) for a game in the following manner. Each table will have 6 players. Total number of players will be a multiple of 6. There are some conditions that must be fulfilled to decide which player takes which table. These conditions are defined later and requires some definitions that we will look into first.  'Distance' between the players: Since these players have been playing with each other in the past, we have history (available in a data set) about who played with whom in the past. Using this player game history we can plot a graph of players where each player is a node in the graph. A player is connected to another player if they have played on the same table in the past. In such a case distance between them is 1.   For example: If Pi and Pj have played on the same table in the past then they are connected with each other and 'Distance' between Pi and Pj is 1. Distance between any 2 players is defined as length of the shortest path between 2 players. If 2 players are not connected then distance between them is same as maximum of distance between any 2 players + 1  Degree of separation of a table Degree of separation of a table is defined as sum of (Distances of all players taken 2 at a time) Example: For a table of 6 players: Degree of separation = Sum of all 15 distances (6 choose 2)  The condition on table formation is: We have to create tables (i.e divide the players into groups) such that Sum of (degree of separation of all the tables) is minimum.  The constraints on data size: Number of history records is upto 100M records Number of unique players in history upto 200K Number of tables possible in the solution is upto 1K
algorithm	2	There's a function that concatenates two strings and returns the length of the resultant string. When called upon a series of strings how do we minimize the cost of using this function. Let's say we have 3 strings, A= "abc", B="def", C = "gh". Now cost of merging AB = 6 and cost of merging the resultant string with C is 8. Thus the total cost is 6 + 8 = 14. However, if we merge A and C, then the cost is 5 and then merge B with this, the cost is 8, so the total cost is 13.  Find an algorithm that minimizes the cost of adding such a series of strings.

There is a group of people who are already seating in that row randomly. i.e. some are sitting together & some are scattered.  Take the row as a String in java.  The seat which is occupied is marked with a character 'X' & which is not occupied is marked with a dot '.'   Now your target is to make the whole group sit together i.e. next to each other and without having any vacant seat between them in such a way that the total number of hops or jumps at the end of the grouping them together should be minimum.  Ok let me try to explain you in details.  Here is the row having 15 seats represented by the String (0, 1, 2, 3, ......... , 14) -                 . . . . x . . x x . . . x . .   Now to make them sit together one of approaches is -   . . . . . . x x x x . . . . .    Following are the steps to achieve this -            1 - Move the person sitting at 4th index to 6th index -   Number of jumps by him =   (6 - 4) = 2            2 - Bring the person sitting at 12th index to 9th index - Number of jumps by him = (12 - 9) = 3           ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------           So now the total number of jumps made = ( 2 + 3) = 5 which is the minimum possible jumps to make them seat together.  There are also other ways to make them sit together but the number of jumps will exceed 5 & that will not be minimum.  For example bring them all towards the starting of the row i.e. start placing them from index 0. In that case the total number of jumps will be ( 4 + 6 + 6 + 9 ) = 25 which is very costly and not an optimized way to do this movement.  Now write an algorithm which will return the minimum number of jumps required to make them sit together.

data-structures	0	Question 3 / 3 (Find first unique character) Find the first unique character in a Stream. Please note that you are being provided a stream as a source for these characters.  The stream is guaranteed to eventually terminate (i.e. return false from a call to the hasNext() method), though it could be very long. You will access this stream through the provided interface methods.  A call to hasNext() will return whether the stream contains any more characters to process. A call to getNext() will return the next character to be processed in the stream.  It is not possible to restart the stream.  If there is no unique character, then return the character '#'. # won't be any character in the character stream.  You just have to complete the function getUniqueCharacter() using the functions hasNext() and getNext() which are already defined.  Example:  Input:  aAbBABac  Output:  b  Input:  aBBa  Output:  #

Consider the roads as a graph with crossings as nodes, and the path between two nodes as an edge. Assume the graph is undirected and the nodes are numbered, 1 to V (V <= 50). The input consists of :     1. An integer H on a line, this is the height of Mr X.     2. Two integers N and M on the next line, where, N is the number of edges in the graph. M is the         number of nodes in the graph.     3. A sequence of N lines each having 4 integers : C1 C2 T D where, C1, C2 are the nodes (or         crossings), T is the time it takes to go from C1 to C2. D is the water depth along the edge(or road)         from C1 to C2.         Note: The depth D has to be less than the height of Mr X for him to be able to take the road.     4.

coding	1	Cross the street ABC Company is involved in the logistics business.  The company has many outlets and stockyards in a city. The city is like an  N  M NM grid. We consider a single cell of the given grid to be a single block in the city. The stockyard is at the upper-left corner and the outlet is located in the lower right corner. Everyday, one of the employees has to travel from the upper left to the lower right corner for supplies. Each block in the city has a height, where the height of the block located at position (i,j) in the grid is equal to A [ i ] [ j ] A[i][j]. The company wants to change the heights of some of the blocks, so that the employee can enjoy a high-speed drive from the stockyard to the outlet. But this change comes at a certain cost.  Specifically, if they change a block height from x to y, then they must pay exactly  | x  y | |xy| dollars. Please help them find the minimum cost, such that by spending that specific amount, they can get a path from stockyard to the outlet with all blocks along the path having the same height.  In a single move, the employee can move from a block to any of its adjacent blocks. Note that during this journey, the employee is allowed to move in all four directions, fulfilling the condition that he never goes out of the grid at any point in time.  Input :  First line contains two positive integers N and M - number of rows and columns in the city. Then, N lines follow, each containing M integers, where the  j t h jth integer on the  i t h ith line denotes  A [ i ] [ j ] A[i][j].  Output :  The first and only line of output should contain minimum cost.  Constraints :  1<= N, M <=100  1<= height of blocks <=100  Sample Input 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 9 9 9 9 1 1 3 3 3 1 1 9 9 9 9 1 1 1 1 1 Sample Output 6 Explanation Optimal path taken by the employee will be : (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (1,5) -> (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (5,3) -> (5,4) -> (5,5) The height of each block along this path can be changed to  1 1, at a total cost of  6 6. There is no way to get a cost less than this.

coding	0	Directi Off Campus Interview Process 2013-14 ....................................................................... This is year 4096 and humans have found a medicine for immortality in the year 2048. Tukro a famous online social networking site founded in the year 3072 was celebrating its 1024th anniversary. To celebrate the occasion its CEO, Shark, and his team had launched a unique personalised video of length 17min 4sec for each user. The video consisted of a collage of all popular posts made by the user on Tukro.  Raka shared this video with all his friends without reviewing it. Immediately after he finished watching the 1024 second length clip he realised that he made a huge mistake. The video was made of all posts made by Raka, irrespective of the privacy settings of the individual post.  A post is compromised if a friend who was not supposed to see the original post, has seen it now. Raka wants to know how many of his posts have been compromised. Tukro provides the list of users who have watched the video till now. Help Raka find how many posts were compromised.  Raka has N friends, identified by a unique integer between 0 and N-1.  Raka has L lists of friends, identified by a unique integer between 0 and L-1.  Each list can be of length at the most N. One friend cannot be added more than once to the same list. A list must have at least one friend. A friend may be added to multiple lists. Visibility of a post in Tukro works through two filters  Include Filter: An array of lists, from the L lists above. Friends can view a post if they belong to any friend list, specified in the Include Filter. Exclude Filter: An array of lists, from the L lists above. Friends can view a post if their name does not belong to any friend list, specified in the Exclude Filter. Some caveats of the above are  If no Filter is active, the post is visible to all friends If only Include Filter is active, a friend can see the post only if he is present in at least one of the lists of Include Filter. If only Exclude Filter is active, a friend can see the post only if he is not present in any of the lists of exclude filter. If both Include and Exclude Filters are active, a friend can see the post if and only if he is present in at least one of the lists of include filter and he is not present in any of the lists of exclude filter if he is present in both an include filter list, and exclude filter list, he should not be able to see the post Input Specification  First line contains a single integer N, the number of friends.  Second line contains a list of integers separated by a single space. The first integer V, represents the number of friends who viewed the video. There are V other integers in the line representing the ID's of friends who viewed the video.  Third line contains a single integer L representing the number of lists.  L lines follow. Each line representing a list. The first integer of the line A, denotes the size of the list; followed by A integers, each denoting the friends in the list.  Next line contains a single integer P denoting the number of posts in the video. 2 * P lines follow. Each pair denoting the Include Filter and Exclude Filters of one post respectively.  First two lines denote the Include and Exclude Filters for first post Next two lines denote the Include and Exclude Filters of second post and so on..  An include filter is represented by a list of space separated integers. The first integer B represents the number of lists in the filter. B may be 0, to denote that the include filter is not active. If B is more than 0, the include filter is active and the next B integers in the line denote the ID's of lists present in the include filter.  Exclude filters are also represented in the same format.  Output Specification  Print a single integer specifying the number of posts that are compromised according to the definition above.  Constraints  1  N  10000 1  V  N 1  L  6 1  P  100000  Note that the constraints on N and P are large. Your solution will exceed time limits if its complexity is O(N*P). Even O(V*P) solutions may exceed time limit! Note the small constraint on L.

java	0	In a Formula-1 challenge, there are n teams numbered 1 to n. Each team has a car and a driver. Cars specification are as follows:   Top speed: (150 + 10 * i) km per hour  Acceleration: (2 * i) meter per second square.  Handling factor (hf) = 0.8  Nitro : Increases the speed to double or top speed, whichever is less. Can be used only once.  Here i is the team number. The cars line up for the race. The start line for (i + 1)th car is 200 * i meters behind the ith car.  All of them start at the same time and try to attain their top speed. A re-assessment of the positions is done every 2 seconds(So even if the car has crossed the finish line in between, youll get to know after 2 seconds). During this assessment, each driver checks if there is any car within 10 meters of his car, his speed reduces to: hf * (speed at that moment). Also, if the driver notices that he is the last one on the race, he uses nitro.  Taking the number of teams and length of track as the input, Calculate the final speeds and the corresponding completion times.

java	0	KingKong, the largest living ape, escaped from Xanadu lab into a forest. The forest is filled with dangerous animals, which will attack and kill human beings that venture too close to them. You are required to help the scientists find a way to get to KingKong safely. The table below gives the minimum distance one must keep from each species for safety.  Animal Name  Code  Safety distance (unit cell)  Lion L 1   Panther P 2   Both, the animals as well as the scientists can move only in horizontal or vertical directions. So, in the figure, the cells shaded gray are the cells into which the scientists must NOT venture, in order to be safe. The arrow shows that the panther is one vertical and one horizontal (a total of two) cell away from it.   A snapshot of the forest is obtained from a satellite picture in terms of an MxN matrix, which is the input to your program. This snapshot gives the location of various animals in the forest. Some cells might contain trees, which merely block the path of the scientists. The cells within the snapshot are marked by:  Animal code indicating the animal present in the cell  'T' in case of a tree present in the cell  'S', which indicates the start position of the scientists  'K', KingKong's location  '#', All other cells, which are empty  The output of your program should be the number of steps in the path that the scientists should take.  Notes:  There will be a unique path, if one exists.  The entire path including the starting position of the scientist as well as KingKong's location must be safe.  Input specification: The first line contains two integers M and N the number of rows and columns. The next M lines contain N characters from the set {'L', 'P', 'T', 'S', 'K', '#'} as explained above  Output specification: An integer specifying the length of the path, from the starting position of the scientist, to KingKong's position both inclusive. If KingKong is not reachable safely, then output the integer '-1'.

brain-teasers	0	4th interview was w/ the tech lead. Asked a puzzle question and told me to use a recursive algorithm. A grasshopper wants to cross a river onto the other side. Partition the length he was to cross into intervals. Each interval either has a at most 1 stone or none. The grasshopper has to jump on the stones to cross the river. It has a speed which is the number of intervals/jump. Initially speed is 0. To get to the 1st stone, speed has to be 1. Given a boolean river array telling if an interval has a stone, call another recursive function to see if it's possible for the grasshopper to cross the river. Speed can only be decreased by one, same, or increased by one. Didn't fully complete this function but he told me I was awefully close.

problem-solving	0	You're the guard of a prison, you want to keep an eye on the most dangerous prisoner. Each prisoner has a danger rank of his own and a group of friends (prisoners, who also have danger ranks). The guard has a list of prisoners with their corresponding danger ranks and he also has a list of the friends of each of the prisoners in the prison.  The danger rank is computed as follows: Prisoner 1 has a danger value of 5, his friends are Prisoner 2 and Prisoner 5, who have danger values of 3 and 4 respectively. So the danger value of Prisoner 1 is 5+3+4 = 12.  There could be any number of prisoners. Whichever prisoner has the highest value is the most dangerous(computed using the above method).  Friendship can be assumed to be symmetric.  Come up with an efficient algorithm to find the most dangerous prisoner?  The solution I came up with runs in quadratic time.  A hash table which has the Prisoner as Key and list of his friends as value Compute the sum of danger rank of all friends one key at a Time. (n * N) Maintain a max count and update it as necessary. I believe there is a solution for this problem having better time complexity than O(N^2).

threads	0	A program has two functions 'reader_func' and 'writer_func'. The reader_func reads shared data and contains a critical section. The writer_func writes to shared data and contains a critical section.   Reader threads call reader_func. Writer threads call writer_func.   The condition is multiple reader threads can access the critical section at the same time as long as they don't access the critical section along with a writer. Only a single writer thread can access the critical section, i.e. no reader or other writer threads are allowed.   Give the code segment, add code that uses mutexes that controls access to the critical sections so that the shared data is not corrupted and satisfies the give conditions. You can create as many mutexes and global variables as you want. Don't emphasize too much on syntax as to how to acquire and release locks on mutexes. Just use mutex.acquire() and mutex.release() .

Unfortunately some members from HYDRA had infiltrated into the SHIELD camp. SHIELD needed to find out all these infiltrators to ensure  that it was not compromised.  Nick Fury, the executive director and the prime SHIELD member figured out that every one in SHIELD could send a SOS signal to every other SHIELD member he knew well. The HYDRA members could send bogus SOS messages  to others to confuse others, but they could never receive a SOS message from a SHIELD member. Every SHIELD member would receive a SOS message ateast one other SHIELD member, who in turn would have received from another SHIELD member and so on till NickFury. SHIELD had a sophisticated mechanism to  capture who sent a SOS signal to whom. Given this information, Nick needed someone to write a program that could look into this data and figure out all HYDRA members.  Sample Input Nick Fury : Tony Stark, Maria Hill, Norman Osborn Hulk : Tony Stark, HawkEye, Rogers Rogers : Thor,  Tony Stark: Pepper Potts, Nick Fury Agent 13 : Agent-X, Nick Fury, Hitler Thor: HawkEye, BlackWidow BlackWidow:Hawkeye Maria Hill : Hulk, Rogers, Nick Fury Agent-X : Agent 13, Rogers Norman Osborn: Tony Stark, Thor  Sample Output Agent 13, Agent-X, Hitler   You can code in any language of your choice.
