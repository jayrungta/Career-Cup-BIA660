Thus the function should return 8 (four 1's with weight 1, one 2 with weight 2)  * Given the list {1,{4,{6}}} the function should return 17 (one 1 with weight 3, one 4 with weight 2, and one 6 with weight 1)

algorithm					Early on I prefer to post the interview questions with a simplified description or only present the algorithmic part of it. Because it's hard for our students to memorize the full description of a problem. Therefore often times only the algorithm behind the question is given.  But somehow a user of this site @concernedCoder gets unhappy with it. So from today on, we will try to recover the original version of the question as much as possible.  We assure you all of the questions we posted are real  questions that you have a good chance to come across during a coding interview. Anyone who has experience in a coding interview should be able to see that.   Here is the full description of a recent Amazon OA question. The reason why we are able to provide the full description is because it's the online assessment. But for an on-site interview it's almost impossible to recover the questions perfectly.  Title: Item Recommendations Amazon wants to recommend items to a customer who has just made a purchase. Amazon's recommendation algorithm is based on item 'connection'. Two items are 'strongly connected' if a single customer bought both of them. Two items are 'weakly connected' if they are both strongly and weakly connected to some other third item.  Your  task is to determine the number of the items strongly and weakly connected to a given item.  You are provided the item id represented as a string, as well as the list of customer purchases represented as an array of strings. Each element in the array consists of a customer id(represented as a string) and an item id (also represented as a string). The two ids are separated by a colon. For example, if they element in the array is "ABJA:Z42G" then that means customer ABJA purchased item Z42G. Your output consists of an array, where the first element in the array represents the number of items strongly connected to the provided item id and the second element represents the number of items weakly connected to the provided item id. For example, if you were provided with the following input: determineRecommendation("ABC",["first:ABC", "first:HIJ", "sec:HIJ", "sec:KLM", "third:NOP", "fourth:ABC", "fourth:QRS", "first"DEF", "fifth:KLM", "fifth:TUV"])  You would return the following array: [3, 2] since ABC is strongly connected to 3 items: DEF, HIJ and QRS and is weakly connected to 2 items: KLM and TUV   Although the description is long, the problem is just asking for 'search (with either DFS or BFS) in a graph'.

algorithm					You have two servers. Both of these servers have an identical file with billion characters except for one single character. These servers are connected over a very slow connection.   How do you find the different character?  My ans: split those files in to batches of characters of 10,000 (say), now calculate checksum and compare the checksums for the chunks of 10,000 character lines. So now you are just comparing 'ints' and not the files per say. (remember the connection is very slow)  His question: How do you optimize this?

algorithm					Given a set of possibly overlapping rectangles in different levels (All of which are "not rotated", can be uniformly represented as (left-bottom,right-top) tuplets), return a minimal set of (non-rotated) non-overlapping rectangles, that occupy the same area.

The TV is on only when there's at least a person in the room. # For each person that comes in, we record the start and end time. We want to know for how long the TV has been on. In other words: # Given a list of arrays of time intervals, write a function that calculates the total amount of time covered by the intervals. # For example:  # input = [(1,4), (2,3)] # > 3 # input = [(4,6), (1,2)] # > 3 # input = {{1,4}, {6,8}, {2,4}, {7,9}, {10, 15}} # > 11

algorithm					Giving a string and an string dictionary, find the longest string in dictionary which can formed by deleting some characters of the giving string. eg:S = abpcplea, Dict = {ale, apple, monkey, plea}, the return "apple"  I was thinking of the following approach,  Build a Trie for all words in the Dict - O( n * k) where k is the longest string in the dict For each character c, in S check if there is a word in Trie that starts with it and has the letters that appear in S after c. We can short circuit based on remaining characters and the length of longest string found so far. This should take O( N * k) where N is length of S.

algorithm					You are the main character in a game where you have to defeat a number of enemies in order. The player has a strength value and an initial amount of money. Each enemy also has a strength value, plus a price.  When facing each enemy you can either: 1) Fight him (if your strength is enough). You keep your money. 2) Bribe him (if you have the necessary money). You subtract the enemy's price from your money, and it joins you and adds its strength to yours.  Given a starting strength and amount of money, calculate the optimal strategy and the amount of money you end with (-1 if impossible).  This can be easily solved recursively in O(2^n) basically trying out each option at every enemy. But is there a polynomial solution, maybe involving DP?

Example: a = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} target  = 8  output = true ({3, 5})  or target = 15 output = true : {3, 5, 8}  but if target = 6, output would be false. since 1 and 5 are not next to each other.

algorithm					Given a dictionary containing a list of words, a starting word, and an ending word, return the minimum number of steps to transform the starting word into the ending word.

algorithm					there are N cities (numbered from 1 to N) in the game and connect them by N-1 highways. It is guaranteed that each pair of cities are connected by the highways directly or indirectly.The game has a very important value called Total Highway Distance (THD) which is the total distances of all pairs of cities. Suppose there are 3 cities and 2 highways. The highway between City 1 and City 2 is 200 miles and the highway between City 2 and City 3 is 300 miles. So the THD is 1000(200 + 500 + 300) miles because the distances between City 1 and City 2, City 1 and City 3, City 2 and City 3 are 200 miles, 500 miles and 300 miles respectively.  During the game the length of some highways may change. you want to know the latest THD.  sample input 3 5 1 2 2 2 3 3 QUERY EDIT 1 2 4 QUERY EDIT 2 3 2 QUERY  sample output 10 14 12

E.g. if arr is [3,4,5,0,1,2] and a = 2 and b = 5, then arr[a:b] = [5,0,1] and let k = 2, so we sort it - get [0,1,5] and take k-th element, that is - 5.  Implement request(a, b, k) function.

Note: Validity means a parenthesis that starts, must end.

Please keep in mind that you can only use each element in the array once when generating a certain x (1<=x<=N). Return the count of the least adding numbers.      For example:      N=6, arr = [1, 3]       1 is already in arr.       add 2 to the arr.       3 is already in arr       4 = 1 + 3       5 = 2 + 3       6 = 1 + 2 + 3       So we return 1 since we only need to add one element which is 2.  Can anyone give some hints?

algorithm					Description  A prospective CS student is investigating how many semesters it will take to graduate from a variety of different universities. Each university provides a list of required courses, their prerequisites, and when each course is offered. Given this information, determine the minimum number of semesters to graduate.  Consider the following example. A student is required to take 4 courses, mt42, cs123, cs456, and cs789. mt42 is only offered in the fall semester and has no prerequisites. Similarly, cs123 is only offered in the spring semester and has no prerequisites. cs456 is only offered in the spring semester and has both cs123 and mt42 as prerequisites. Finally, cs789 is offered in both fall and spring and has cs456 as its only prerequisite. The shortest time to graduate is 5 semesters, by taking mt42 in the fall, cs123 in the next spring, cs456 the following spring (since it is not offered in the fall) and finally cs789 the following fall.  For this problem, there are only two semesters, fall and spring. Always start counting semesters from the fall.  In addition to the fall/spring scheduling issues, there is one slight complication. In order to keep the dormitories full, each university limits the number of courses that can be taken in any semester. This limit appears as part of the input data. The third example below illustrates this issue.  Input  There are one to twenty-five data sets, followed by a final line containing only the integers -1 -1. A data set starts with a line containing two positive integers n, 1 <= n <= 12, which is the number of courses in this data set and m, 2 <= m <= 6, which is the maximum number of courses that can be taken in any single semester. The next line contains the n course identifiers. Each is a 1-5 character string from the set {a-z, 0-9}. Following the course identifiers is the individual course information. This consists of n lines, one line for each course, containing the course identifier, semester offered ('F'=Fall, 'S'=Spring, 'B'=Both semesters), the number of prerequisite courses, p, 0 <= p <= 5, and finally p prerequisite course identifiers. The first example data set below corresponds to the problem described above.  Output  The output contains one line for each data set, formatted as shown in the sample output.  Sample Input  4 6 cs123 mt42 cs456 cs789 mt42 F 0 cs123 S 0 cs456 S 2 cs123 mt42 cs789 B 1 cs456 3 6 math1 comp2 comp3 comp3 S 1 comp2 math1 S 0 comp2 F 1 math1 4 3 m10 m20 c33 c44 m10 B 0 m20 B 0 c33 B 0 c44 B 0 -1 -1 Sample Output  The minimum number of semesters required to graduate is 5. The minimum number of semesters required to graduate is 4. The minimum number of semesters required to graduate is 2.

algorithm					Say you have a keypad that has keys for the numbers 0 through 9 and the correct code is some sequence of 5 digits. This keypad does *not* reset after entering an incorrect sequence of 5 digits. ie. If the correct sequence is 12345, entering 7512345 will succeed in opening it because it ends in the correct sequence. If the keypad actually resets after every 5 digits pressed, then it would not succeed b/c it would interpret the above sequence as "75123" then "45".  1. Write an algorithm that will try to find the correct code for this keypad. Assume you have an API similar to KeyPad.pressKey(int n) where you pass in a number (0...9) and it returns true if the keypad unlocks and false if it's still locked.  Note that you could easily enter all digits of all numbers 00000 through 99999 resulting in 5*100000 key presses, but remember that the panel does not reset after every sequence of 5 digits, so find a way to do this more efficiently. Notice for example that entering the stream 3791283780 will test the length 5 sequences 37912, 79128, 91283, 12837, 28378, 83780; not only the two disjoint sequences 37912 and 83780.  Think of this keypad as remembering the last 4 keys pressed (and the order pressed); when the next key is pressed, if the last 4 keys + the current key equal the correct code, the keypad will unlock. Assume the keypad does all this internally, so you can just keep feeding it keypresses and it will eventually unlock if the last 5 keypresses entered is the correct code.  2. Generalize your algorithm to work for a keypad where you don't know the length of the correct sequence in advance.

algorithm					In the game of Jack Straws, a number of plastic or wooden "straws" are dumped on the table and players try to remove them one-by-one without disturbing the other straws. In the question here, we are concerned with the following, related problem: First n straws are dumped on the table. Next, for every pair of straws, we want to determine if the straws are connected by a path of touching straws. In other words, given a list of the endpoints for n > 1 straws (as if they were dumped on a large piece of graph paper), determine all the pairs of straws that are connected. Note that touching is connecting, but also two straws can be connected indirectly via other connected straws. Give an algorithm to compute all the pairs of straws that are connected. Here is some additional information that you can use:   As a basic step you need to determine whether two straws directly touch (intersect), i.e., whether straw ab with end points a and b intersects with straw cd (with end points c and d). To get full credit also explain how the elementary step i) can be done. If you cannot find an algorithm for this step, assume an O(n 2 ) algorithm and explain how to find all pairs of straws that are connected.

algorithm					Implement cycle detection for a spreadsheet with the characteristics outline below.  Your solution should include working data structures to represent the spreadsheet and operate on a "entire" spreadsheet to indicate which cells have circular dependencies.  Spreadsheet  The spreadsheet is a collection of cells within a 2-D space of columns and rows.  Columns are defined with a letter and rows are defined by a number.  You can assume an upper limit of 26 columns for simplicity.  Cell values are either a number (long or double) or an expression containing numbers, operators, and references to other cells (i.e. B2 means the second column [B] and second row [2]).  You can ignore the parsing of expressions for this exercise.  Instead, your solution can define the data you will work with after expressions have been parsed.

We want to find the diameter of the graph each time we add a new node. Note that each edge cost 1.  Input Format:  First line of the input contains one integer N, indicating how many new nodes we will add.  Then following N lines. The ith line contains an integer X, which means we add the ith node and an edge connecting the Xth node and ith node.  The original node is the 0th node.  Output Format:  Output N lines. The ith line is an integer indicating the diameter of the graph after adding the ith node.  Constraints:  0 < N <= 100000  0 <= Xi < i  i is counting from 1  Sample Input:  5  0  0  1  1  1  Sample Output:  1  2  3  3  3  Explanation:  Firstly the graph contains only node 0. The first line of output is 1 because the diameter becomes 1 when node 1 is added and connected to node 0. Diameter becomes 2 after adding node 2 to node 0. Then adding node 3, 4, 5, all of them are connecting to node 1, caculate the shortest path of all pairs of nodes, the maximum shortest path is 3, so the last 3 lines of output are all 3.

Two characters adjacent to _ (both on the same side of _) can be reversed along with the _ if both characters are different, example, aa_ba can be changed to aaab_ but not to _aaba because both characters are a.

algorithm					Asked at Walmart Labs ---------------------------------- There is a row of seats. Assume that it contains 15 seats adjacent to each other. There is a group of people who are already seating in that row randomly. i.e. some are sitting together & some are scattered.  Take the row as a String in java.  The seat which is occupied is marked with a character 'X' & which is not occupied is marked with a dot '.'   Now your target is to make the whole group sit together i.e. next to each other and without having any vacant seat between them in such a way that the total number of hops or jumps at the end of the grouping them together should be minimum.  Ok let me try to explain you in details.  Here is the row having 15 seats represented by the String (0, 1, 2, 3, ......... , 14) -                 . . . . x . . x x . . . x . .   Now to make them sit together one of approaches is -   . . . . . . x x x x . . . . .    Following are the steps to achieve this -            1 - Move the person sitting at 4th index to 6th index -   Number of jumps by him =   (6 - 4) = 2            2 - Bring the person sitting at 12th index to 9th index - Number of jumps by him = (12 - 9) = 3           ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------           So now the total number of jumps made = ( 2 + 3) = 5 which is the minimum possible jumps to make them seat together.  There are also other ways to make them sit together but the number of jumps will exceed 5 & that will not be minimum.  For example bring them all towards the starting of the row i.e. start placing them from index 0. In that case the total number of jumps will be ( 4 + 6 + 6 + 9 ) = 25 which is very costly and not an optimized way to do this movement.  Now write an algorithm which will return the minimum number of jumps required to make them sit together.

For example , Let's say words are  ABC BCD CBA Now if user types 'A' we have to suggest  him 'B' as next character because if you see at second position in all words 'B' is occurring most number of times ( 2 times ). similarly if he types 'AB' then we need to suggest him third character as 'C' as in third index all words have same occurrence but 'C' comes first.

data-structures					Given two (dictionary) words as Strings, determine if they are isomorphic. Two words are called isomorphic  if the letters in one word can be remapped to get the second word.

Question is: what data structure will you actually use for storing the fixed set of floating point numbers to achieve this?  Edit: I missed to add. The interviewer further mentioned that I can not sort and that I can use any amount of time for creating the data structure (meaning this need not be efficient).  Since, I am not allowed to 'sort', I assumed that I can not use BST as I will have to compare numbers while populating the tree. But I didn't clarify it with him; I should have in hindsight.

data-structures					Q: If you have all the companies that are traded, and live inputs are coming of which company is being traded and what is the volume, how do you maintain the data, so that you can carry out operation of giving the top 10 most traded companies by volume of shares most efficiently. A: I juggled between Hash Map and Max Heap. I said Max Heap, since I can take out top 10 companies in a jiffy with a Max Heap. But then he asked you will need to find a company everytime there is a trade, which will take quite some time in Heap. He pointed out that in real world scenario, number of trades happening, and hence searching of the company and updating it, will be many times more than finding top 10. Which bought me to HashMap. Updations can happen in Real time, while finding top 10 can be done in O(n) or O(nlog(n)) time. Even that wasn't optimal obviously. The interviewer was very nice and friendly type guy. He stressed that at every trade, at most, only 1 company will change in my top 10. This hit me and got me to the correct answer that we keep all actual data in HashMap, but also maintain a MinHeap of 10 most traded company.

data-structures					Had my first and second phone interview with Amazon. I was dropped. This site has been a great help towards my preparation and most questions are based on what you find here. Posting my Questions is a small way of saying Thanks!  Interview 1: 1. What is polymorphism. 2. Design an OO parking lot. What classes and functions will it have. It should say, full, empty and also be able to find spot for Valet parking. The lot has 3 different types of parking: regular, handicapped and compact. 3. Coding: I have an integer array where every number appears even number of times and only one appears odd times. Find the number. (I said hashtable and he asked me to write code with Hashtable) 4. What data structure would you use to look up phone numbers for customer names. (I said Hashtable. Asked why hashtable, why not a tree. I said HT has O(1). Asked is order always 1, when more than O(1) in HT.   Second Interview: 1. Starter: Describe your college projects. 2. OO Design: Design a deck of cards. What classes, data structures will you use? How will you shuffle the cards? How will you divide (deck) among players. What class/function do you need to denote players and where will you add them? What class/function do you need to deck? What if I need to add 2 jokers to the deck of 52 cards.  3. Data Structures: How will you use a hashtable to find data in a tree. (Then he rephrased) suppose I have a hashtable, I want to store the data in a tree instead of a bucket. How will I do it. What complexity to find an element.  4. Bits & Bytes: Find if a binary representation of a number is palindrome. The function should work irrespective of number of bytes for an integer. Suppose if our machine is 4 bytes for an int, how will you use the program for 8 byte machine.  5. Unix: Suppose I have 100's of html files in many directories. I want to find the files having phone numbers.   b) Suppose I have 2 files having phone numbers, find the repeating phone numbers. (I said sort and grep). Then he asked what if the lines cannot be sorted.   All the best guys. I think the second interview was challenging since the interviewer was prodding until he heard a leave me alone. So it means that though they are based on questions in cc, be prepared for extensions. I think this site is all you need to prepare for Amazon interview.

coding					Cross the street ABC Company is involved in the logistics business.  The company has many outlets and stockyards in a city. The city is like an  N  M NM grid. We consider a single cell of the given grid to be a single block in the city. The stockyard is at the upper-left corner and the outlet is located in the lower right corner. Everyday, one of the employees has to travel from the upper left to the lower right corner for supplies. Each block in the city has a height, where the height of the block located at position (i,j) in the grid is equal to A [ i ] [ j ] A[i][j]. The company wants to change the heights of some of the blocks, so that the employee can enjoy a high-speed drive from the stockyard to the outlet. But this change comes at a certain cost.  Specifically, if they change a block height from x to y, then they must pay exactly  | x  y | |xy| dollars. Please help them find the minimum cost, such that by spending that specific amount, they can get a path from stockyard to the outlet with all blocks along the path having the same height.  In a single move, the employee can move from a block to any of its adjacent blocks. Note that during this journey, the employee is allowed to move in all four directions, fulfilling the condition that he never goes out of the grid at any point in time.  Input :  First line contains two positive integers N and M - number of rows and columns in the city. Then, N lines follow, each containing M integers, where the  j t h jth integer on the  i t h ith line denotes  A [ i ] [ j ] A[i][j].  Output :  The first and only line of output should contain minimum cost.  Constraints :  1<= N, M <=100  1<= height of blocks <=100  Sample Input 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 9 9 9 9 1 1 3 3 3 1 1 9 9 9 9 1 1 1 1 1 Sample Output 6 Explanation Optimal path taken by the employee will be : (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (1,5) -> (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (5,3) -> (5,4) -> (5,5) The height of each block along this path can be changed to  1 1, at a total cost of  6 6. There is no way to get a cost less than this.

coding					Programming Challenge Description:  Develop a service to help a client quickly find a manager who can resolve the conflict between two employees. When there is a conflict between two employees, the closest common manager should help resolve the conflict. The developers plan to test the service by providing an example reporting hierarchy to enable the identification of the closest common manager for two employees. Your goal is to develop an algorithm for IBM to efficiently perform this task. To keep things simple, they just use a single relationship "isManagerOf" between any two employees. For example, consider a reporting structure represented as a set of triples:  Tom isManagerOf Mary Mary isManagerOf Bob Mary isManagerOf Sam Bob isManagerOf John Sam isManagerOf Pete Sam isManagerOf Katie  The manager who should resolve the conflict between Bob and Mary is Tom(Mary's manager). The manager who should resolve the conflict between Pete and Katie is Sam(both employees' manager). The manager who should resolve the conflict between Bob and Pete is Mary(Bob's manager and Pete's manager's manager).   Assumptions: There will be at least one isManagerOf relationship. There can be a maximum of 15 team member to a single manager No cross management would exist i.e., a person can have only one manager There can be a maximum of 100 levels of manager relationships in the corporation  Input:  R1,R2,R3,R4...Rn,Person1,Person2 R1...Rn - A comma separated list of "isManagerOf" relationships. Each relationship being represented by an arrow "Manager->Person". Person1,Person2 - The name of the two employee that have conflict Output:  The name of the manager who can resolve the conflict Note: Please be prepared to provide a video follow-up response to describe your approach to this exercise.  Test 1: Test Input  Frank->Mary,Mary->Sam,Mary->Bob,Sam->Katie,Sam->Pete,Bob->John,Bob,Katie   Expected Output  Mary   Test 2: Test Input  Sam->Pete,Pete->Nancy,Sam->Katie,Mary->Bob,Frank->Mary,Mary->Sam,Bob->John,Sam,John  Expected Output  Mary

Eg:   1. abab <------yes, ab is repeated 2. abba <---- No, a and b follow different order  3. acbdaghfb <-------- yes there is a followed by b at two places 4. abcdacb <----- yes a followed by b twice  The above should be applicable to ANY TWO (or every two) characters in the string and optimum over time.  In the sense, it should be checked for every pair of characters in the string.

coding					Implement  bool isBST(Tree * root)

coding					You are given a string S. Each character of S is either a, or b. You wish to reverse exactly one sub-string of S such that the new string is lexicographically smaller than all the other strings that you can get by reversing exactly one sub-string. For example, given abab, you may choose to reverse the substring ab that starts from index 2 (0-based). This gives you the string abba. But, if you choose the reverse the substring ba starting from index 1, you will get aabb. There is no way of getting a smaller string, hence reversing the substring in the range [1, 2] is optimal.  Input: First line contains a number T, the number of test cases. Each test case contains a single string S. The characters of the string will be from the set { a, b }.  Output: For each test case, print two numbers separated by comma; for example x,y (without the quotes and without any additional whitespace). x,y describe the starting index (0-based) and ending index respectively of the substring that must be reversed in order to acheive the smallest lexicographical string. If there are multiple possible answers, print the one with the smallest x. If there are still multiple answers possible, print the one with the smallest y.  Constraints: 1 ?

Your solution should take as its first argument the name of a plain text file that contains one word per line.  The remaining arguments define the list of legal letters. A letter may not appear in any single word more times than it appears in the list of letters (e.g., the input letters a a b c k can make back and cab but not abba).   Here's an example of how it should work:   prompt> word-maker WORD.LST w g d a s x z c y t e i o b  ['azotised', 'bawdiest', 'dystocia', 'geotaxis', 'iceboats', 'oxidates', 'oxyacids', 'sweatbox', 'tideways']   Tip: Just return the longest words which match, not all.

coding					In Amazon's interview, Round 2 they asked question:  Write a program to print inorder traversal of two trees.   Both values must be printed alternatively.  e.g. if inorder traversal of tree 1 is 10, 15, 20 and tree 2 is 100, 150, 200 then it should print 10, 100, 15, 150, 20, 200.  I tried printing it recursively by calling 2 functions recursively (f1 calls f2, then f2 calls f1 and so on).  I don't know where my approach is going wrong? I know there are other ways to do it as well but in this approach what is the mistake?

coding					Implement a simple regex parser which, given a string and a pattern, returns a boolean indicating whether the input matches the pattern. By simple, we mean that the regex can only contain one special character: * (star). The star means what you'd expect, that there will be zero or more of any character in that place in the pattern. However, multiple consecutive stars are allowed. Some examples of valid input (and expected output):  f(a*b, acb) => true f(abc*, abbc) => false f(**bc, bc) => true

coding					Q: Do you know what is a Binary tree? How would you go about coding for addition of a new element to Binary tree? A: I asked if they want a Binary Tree or a BST? When he said BST I just said we can have a recursive function in which we pass the root of the tree and see if the value to be added is smaller or bigger than the root, and depending on result, we go to left or right of the tree, assuming the left (or right) is not null. If null, just use new to create a memory location, put the value, and use the left reference of the root to link to this new memory.	Simple basic stuff.

coding					I Got this Crazy Question on PHONE INTERVIEW AT GOOGLE:  Design and implement a class to generate random numbers in an arbitrary probability distribution given by an array of integer weights, i.e. for int[] w return a number, n, from 0 to w.length - 1 with probability w[n] / sum(w). Using an existing random number generator with a uniform distribution is permitted.  Example distribution: w = 1, 2, 3, 2, 1  Example probabilities: w / sum = 1/9, 2/9, 1/3, 2/9, 1/9  Example results: n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4  Documentation:  Class java.util.Random  public int nextInt(int n)  Returns a pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value between 0 (inclusive) and the specified value (exclusive), drawn from this random number generator's sequence. The general contract of nextInt is that one int value in the specified range is pseudorandomly generated and returned. All n possible int values are produced with (approximately) equal probability.  Parameters: n - the bound on the random number to be returned. Must be positive. Returns: the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value between 0 (inclusive) and n (exclusive) from this random number generator's sequence Throws: IllegalArgumentException - if n is not positive

coding					"Count and Say problem" Write a code to do following: n                 String to print 0                 1 1                 1 1 2                 2 1 3                 1 2 1 1 ... Base case: n = 0 print "1" for n = 1, look at previous string and write number of times a digit is seen and the digit itself. In this case, digit 1 is seen 1 time in a row... so print "1 1" for n = 2, digit 1 is seen two times in a row, so print "2 1" for n = 3, digit 2 is seen 1 time and then digit 1 is seen 1 so print "1 2 1 1" for n = 4 you will print "1 1 1 2 2 1"  Consider the numbers as integers for simplicity. e.g. if previous string is "10 1" then the next will be "1 10 1 1" and the next one will be "1 1 1 10 2 1"

coding					Design a One shot timer library capable of supporting multiple times simultaneously. Cancel is also supported. Only ONE hardware timer register.So basically, a process/function can call SetTime(10) and it will get notified after 10 seconds. It can also say SetTime(2)... SetTime(7). Then it will get two notifications, one after 2 and one after 7. [SetTime returns a handle]  The process(s) can also issue a cancel. Cancel(handle), to cancel a specific timer they set.   The hardware timer registers, assume decrements by 1 every 1 second. So if you set it to 10, it will notify you after 10 seconds. Basically it interrupts, and lets say calls RegExpired(). You can Read/Write this register anytime very fast (uS).  The key here how you make use of this single register to support any number of timer events that applications/processes are demanding asynchronously.  Discuss the data structure you would use and implement it in C.

Posting my Questions is a small way of saying Thanks!  Interview 1: 1. What is polymorphism. 2. Design an OO parking lot. What classes and functions will it have. It should say, full, empty and also be able to find spot for Valet parking. The lot has 3 different types of parking: regular, handicapped and compact. 3. Coding: I have an integer array where every number appears even number of times and only one appears odd times. Find the number. (I said hashtable and he asked me to write code with Hashtable) 4. What data structure would you use to look up phone numbers for customer names. (I said Hashtable. Asked why hashtable, why not a tree. I said HT has O(1). Asked is order always 1, when more than O(1) in HT.   Second Interview: 1. Starter: Describe your college projects. 2. OO Design: Design a deck of cards. What classes, data structures will you use? How will you shuffle the cards? How will you divide (deck) among players. What class/function do you need to denote players and where will you add them? What class/function do you need to deck? What if I need to add 2 jokers to the deck of 52 cards.  3. Data Structures: How will you use a hashtable to find data in a tree. (Then he rephrased) suppose I have a hashtable, I want to store the data in a tree instead of a bucket. How will I do it. What complexity to find an element.  4. Bits & Bytes: Find if a binary representation of a number is palindrome. The function should work irrespective of number of bytes for an integer. Suppose if our machine is 4 bytes for an int, how will you use the program for 8 byte machine.  5. Unix: Suppose I have 100's of html files in many directories. I want to find the files having phone numbers.   b) Suppose I have 2 files having phone numbers, find the repeating phone numbers. (I said sort and grep). Then he asked what if the lines cannot be sorted.   All the best guys. I think the second interview was challenging since the interviewer was prodding until he heard a leave me alone.

Then the same question which need use of "uniq" command of UNIX.

coding					Function which lists all the possible dates for given year.

coding					Background:For any perimeter of a rectangle, there may be multiple different dimensions that result in that specificperimeter. When there are multiple dimensions for the same perimeter, there may also be multiple areas. In other words, any one perimeter can result in different areas depending on the possible combinations of dimensions that can make that perimeter.Definition:A dimension or instance of dimensions for a rectangle is a pair of length and width values. A dimension with length 5 and width 4 is considered the same as a dimension with length 4 and width 5. The area of a rectangle is the length multiplied by the width. The perimeter of a rectangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of all 4 sides or the sum of 2 multiplied by the width and 2 multiplied by the length.Requirement:A finite set of possible perimeters of a rectangle exist given a maximum perimeter, minimum length of any side, and the constraint that all sides are whole numbers; we will call this set U. Find the subset of perimeters in set U where all of the possible dimensions for a perimeter in the subset have areas common with the areas of one or more other perimeters in set U. Your program should take the minimum length of any side and the maximum perimeter, respectively, as command line arguments and output a comma separated list of the perimeters that meet the criteria explained above, sorted from lowest to highest. The program should be submitted in a single Java class with an implemented main function that provides the correct output given the two input arguments.Example:javac YourClass.javajava YourClass 1 6410,14,18,20,22,26,30,34Please make sure your program can be run with the exact syntax above. You can name the class anything you like, but the class name will be passed to a program that will compile it and then run a set of tests on the resulting program. It is important that your class will compile and run from within a local directory, not a package directory.

c-plus-plus					Abstract We are planning an orienteering game. The aim of this game is to arrive at the goal (G) from the start (S) with the shortest distance. However, the players have to pass all the checkpoints (@) on the map. An orienteering map is to be given in the following format.  ########  #@....G#  ##.##@##  #..@..S#  #@.....#  ######## In this problem, an orienteering map is to be given. Calculate the minimum distance from the start to the goal with passing all the checkpoints. Specification * A map consists of 5 characters as following.  You can assume that the map does not contain any invalid characters and  the map has exactly one start symbol 'S' and exactly one goal symbol 'G'.   * 'S' means the orienteering start.  * 'G' means the orienteering goal.  * '@' means an orienteering checkpoint.  * '.' means an opened-block that players can pass.  * '#' means a closed-block that players cannot pass. * It is allowed to move only by one step vertically or horizontally (up, down, left, or right) to the  next block.  Other types of movements, such as moving diagonally (left up, right up, left down and right down) and skipping one or more blocks, are NOT permitted. * You MUST NOT get out of the map. * Distance is to be defined as the number of movements to the different blocks. * You CAN pass opened-blocks, checkpoints, the start, and the goal more than once if necessary. * You can assume that parameters satisfy following conditions.   * 1 <= width <= 100  * 1 <= height <= 100  * The maximum number of checkpoints is 18.  * Return -1 if given arguments do not satisfy specifications, or players cannot arrive at the goal  from the start by passing all the checkpoints. 1/6 Examination 1 *You can choose Java or C++

Please make sure that your answer will work even  if the size of the char * desired is not known in the outside calling  function. Avoid (do no use) C++ syntax. Include statement in called and  calling functions. Use food programming practice.

Then interviewer asked me to decrease space complexity, for which i gave solution as sorting the given array (in nlogn time) and then find the pairs in O(n) time, and hence total time complexity was O(nlogn) and space complexity as O(1).  But interviewer kept pressing for a better time complexity (than O(nlogn)) with O(1) space complexity.  How is it possible, i could not think of any way.

java					Programming Challenge Description:  Develop a service to help a client quickly find a manager who can resolve the conflict between two employees. When there is a conflict between two employees, the closest common manager should help resolve the conflict. The developers plan to test the service by providing an example reporting hierarchy to enable the identification of the closest common manager for two employees. Your goal is to develop an algorithm for IBM to efficiently perform this task. To keep things simple, they just use a single relationship "isManagerOf" between any two employees. For example, consider a reporting structure represented as a set of triples:  Tom isManagerOf Mary Mary isManagerOf Bob Mary isManagerOf Sam Bob isManagerOf John Sam isManagerOf Pete Sam isManagerOf Katie  The manager who should resolve the conflict between Bob and Mary is Tom(Mary's manager). The manager who should resolve the conflict between Pete and Katie is Sam(both employees' manager). The manager who should resolve the conflict between Bob and Pete is Mary(Bob's manager and Pete's manager's manager).   Assumptions: There will be at least one isManagerOf relationship. There can be a maximum of 15 team member to a single manager No cross management would exist i.e., a person can have only one manager There can be a maximum of 100 levels of manager relationships in the corporation  Input:  R1,R2,R3,R4...Rn,Person1,Person2 R1...Rn - A comma separated list of "isManagerOf" relationships. Each relationship being represented by an arrow "Manager->Person". Person1,Person2 - The name of the two employee that have conflict Output:  The name of the manager who can resolve the conflict Note: Please be prepared to provide a video follow-up response to describe your approach to this exercise.  Test 1: Test Input  Frank->Mary,Mary->Sam,Mary->Bob,Sam->Katie,Sam->Pete,Bob->John,Bob,Katie   Expected Output  Mary   Test 2: Test Input  Sam->Pete,Pete->Nancy,Sam->Katie,Mary->Bob,Frank->Mary,Mary->Sam,Bob->John,Sam,John  Expected Output  Mary

java					Input will be a matrix consiting of only 1's n 0's. The 1's represent the lines and 0's its absence.  For eg a matrix 6X7 is shown  0   0   0   1   1   1   1  0   1   1   1   0   1   1  0   1   0   1   0   1   1  0   1   0   1   0   1   1  0   1   1   1   0   1   1  0   0   0   1   1   1   1    In the above matrix, the sequence of 1s represents the lines. These eight lines constitute three  rectangles.   Conditons :   1. The rectangles will always enclose some 0s. e.g. last two vertical lines does not constitute a  rectangle.   2.  A rectangle can contain multiple rectangles    Output : should be no. of rectangles formed in the matrix(intersecting rectangles are also counted).

java					You have been asked to deploy a number of robotic domestic helpers (RDH) into a large room to remotely clean it as they move around it. This room is currently rectangular in shape and must be navigated by the RDHs in order to successfully clean the room.  A RDH position and location is represented by a combination of x and y co-ordinates and a letter representing one of the four cardinal compass points. The room is divided up into a grid to simplify navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the RDH is in the bottom left corner and facing North.  In order to control a RDH the operator sends a simple string of letters. The possible letters are 'L', 'R' and 'M'. 'L' and 'R' makes the robot spin 90 degrees left or right respectively, without moving from its current spot.  'M' means move forward one grid point, and maintain the same heading.  Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).  INPUT: The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the arena, the lower-left coordinates are assumed to be 0,0.  The rest of the input is information pertaining to the RDHs that have been deployed. Each RDH has two lines of input. The first line gives the RDHs initial deployed position, and the second line is a series of instructions telling the RDH how to navigate around the room.  The position is made up of two integers and a letter separated by spaces, corresponding to the x and y co-ordinates and the RDHs orientation.  Each RDH will be finished sequentially, which means that the second RDH won't start to move until the first one has finished moving.   OUTPUT The output for each RDH should be its final co-ordinates and heading.  INPUT AND OUTPUT  Test Input: 7 6 2 4 E MMRMMRMRRM 3 4 N LMLMLMLMM  Expected Output: 4 2 E 43e3 5 N

java					Had my first and second phone interview with Amazon. I was dropped. This site has been a great help towards my preparation and most questions are based on what you find here. Posting my Questions is a small way of saying Thanks!  Interview 1: 1. What is polymorphism. 2. Design an OO parking lot. What classes and functions will it have. It should say, full, empty and also be able to find spot for Valet parking. The lot has 3 different types of parking: regular, handicapped and compact. 3. Coding: I have an integer array where every number appears even number of times and only one appears odd times. Find the number. (I said hashtable and he asked me to write code with Hashtable) 4. What data structure would you use to look up phone numbers for customer names. (I said Hashtable. Asked why hashtable, why not a tree. I said HT has O(1). Asked is order always 1, when more than O(1) in HT.   Second Interview: 1. Starter: Describe your college projects. 2. OO Design: Design a deck of cards. What classes, data structures will you use? How will you shuffle the cards? How will you divide (deck) among players. What class/function do you need to denote players and where will you add them? What class/function do you need to deck? What if I need to add 2 jokers to the deck of 52 cards.  3. Data Structures: How will you use a hashtable to find data in a tree. (Then he rephrased) suppose I have a hashtable, I want to store the data in a tree instead of a bucket. How will I do it. What complexity to find an element.  4. Bits & Bytes: Find if a binary representation of a number is palindrome. The function should work irrespective of number of bytes for an integer. Suppose if our machine is 4 bytes for an int, how will you use the program for 8 byte machine.  5. Unix: Suppose I have 100's of html files in many directories. I want to find the files having phone numbers.   b) Suppose I have 2 files having phone numbers, find the repeating phone numbers. (I said sort and grep). Then he asked what if the lines cannot be sorted.   All the best guys. I think the second interview was challenging since the interviewer was prodding until he heard a leave me alone. So it means that though they are based on questions in cc, be prepared for extensions. I think this site is all you need to prepare for Amazon interview.

brain-teasers					You are given a flat room 1x1 metres, a position of victim in it (v_x, v_y) and a position of a killer (k_x, k_y) both inside this room (in range [0, 1]). Then the killer shoots once at some direction. The bullet reflects of the walls as if it was a light ray - if it falls under angle X degrees, it will reflect at angle X  degrees, if it gets into the corner it just reflects back. If the bullet hits guardian (see below) it stops and killer fails. Write a function that will be given coordinates of victim and a killer and will return a list of coordinates of guardians such that it's impossible for a killer to kill victim.  That is, whichever direction the killer will shoot, the bullet will never reach victim, or will be stopped by a guardian.  Here is an example for the case when we assume the walls don't reflect bullet (for simplicity): killer: (0, 0), victim: (1, 1). The solution to this simplified problem is to place 1 guardian between killer and victim e.g. on (0.1, 0.1).  Your task is to do this with accounting bullet reflection. E.g. in the previous case the killer can shoot at (1/3, 1), the bullet will reflect to (2/3, 0) and finally get to the victim at (1, 1).

You can't tell the assistant which coin, which side, or which diagonal to use. You can either think of your assistant as being extremely dumb, or that the table is being constantly rotated by external forces. What is the sequence of commands that you should give to your assistant to make sure the coins start jumping up and down?

brain-teasers					Distributing Medals It's the medal distribution ceremony. 10^6 police officers, numbered from 1 to 10^6, are standing in a line.

brain-teasers					What is the minimum representation in bits of two positions on an 8x8 chessboard?

brain-teasers					There is a fictional company called fooBar in fooLand. The CEO of fooBar, fooMan, directs all managers to minimize the total hike that they give to employees, while ensuring that the hike is fair to them. Usually, this is done by giving more hike to employees who are rated better. So, for example, if an employee is rated 2 and is given hike 3x, an employee rated 3 should be given a hike greater than 3x. Hikes are always in multiples of x only and the minimum hike to be given to any employee is x.  This year, however, a wicked manager, barMan comes up with a brilliant strategy. He assumes that each employee would get to know the hike of only the two employees who sit next to him (one on the left, one on the right). And therefore, he reasons(using whole of his analytical left brain), that as long as he could make hikes fair for each employee with respect to the two employees that sit next to him, he would fulfill the dual objective of being "fair" as well as minimizing the total hike given. Just for clarification, the employees of each team sit in one big line.   barMan hires you to calculate the hike to be given to each employee. Over to you. You are supposed to come up with the total hike number that will excite barMan and make him roll on the floor laughing. You are given that no two employee sitting next to each other would have a common rating.  Input:  The order of rating of each employee should be in the order in which they sit. First line will be the value of x. The second line will be the number of employees 'n'. The next 'n' lines specify the rating of each employee. Rating can be integers from 1 to 105. (weird, right?)   1 <= n <= 105. 1 <= x <= 104.  Sample input 1:  10 4 1 4 6 2  Output: 70  Why? If we have the hikes as first employee gets 10, second gets 20, third gets 30 and fourth gets 10, we satisfy all our constraints.

Each node contains a value representing the population of the city, and a list of neighbors. (feel free to extend data structure)  Every time there is a baseball game at a city, everyone from all the different cities will go to the city with the baseball game.  Return the maximum traffic between a city and its neighbours when there is a game at that city, for all cities. (Does not have to be sorted)   The total run-time after returning everything should be O(n).  Examples:

trees-and-graphs					Given a Binary Tree (balanced or not) write a method that transforms the tree in a degenerate tree (basically a data structure like a sorted linked list where each node has the left child null) and returns the new root. This must be made in place, no external memory usage is allowed.

trees-and-graphs					One of the many ways of representing a tree is to have an array(of length same as number of nodes), where each element in the node denotes the parent of that node.											  Eg - {-1, 0, 0, 1, 1} would represent a tree with - * 0 as root * 1 and 2 as children of 0 * 3 and 4 as children of 1  Given a similar representation, you have to print reverse level order traversal of the corresponding tree.  Level order traversal of a tree is where we traverse levels of tree one by one.  Eg - For the above given tree, level order traversal would be - 0 1 2 3 4 And hence, the reverse level order traversal is - 3 4 1 2 0 Please note - * An element with parent = -1 is the root element. * An element with the least index becomes the left most child. (ie. a node with always be on left of all its siblings that have higher index than it) * When printing a level of tree you need to maintain left to right order.  Input Format - First line of the input contains number of nodes in the tree (N) Next line contains N (space seperated) numbers that denote where i-th number will denote the parent node of i-th node.  Output Format - Print reverse level order traversal of the corresponding tree, with every new level starting in a different line. Notes/Limits - * 1 <= N <= 50 * There will be only one root element in any given test case * Given numbers will always form a valid undivided tree * Output should be in the exact format as specified (including whitespaces) Sample Test Cases -	 		 Input - 5 -1 0 0 2 1 Output - 4 3 1 2 0  Input - 9 8 7 0 5 5 8 7 0 -1 Output - 1 6 2 7 3 4 0 5 8 Input - 45 24 42 4 30 29 43 22 15 26 36 26 16 3 22 21 41 18 16 34 41 12 29 32 30 43 15 4 38 36 -1 24 42 18 6 21 38 6 17 32 17 3 34 12 14 14 Output - 1 31 20 42 9 28 12 40 33 36 3 23 37 39 6 13 27 35  0 30 11 17 22 38 7 25 5 24 16 32 15 19 8 10 43 44 18 41 2 26 14 34 4 21 29  Input - 33 17 25 0 14 7 2 5 25 18 8 16 27 10 9 19 7 31 31 19 0 8 14 9 17 18 2 30 16 30 10 5 -1 27 Output - 13 22 26 28 4 15 9 20 6 30 1 7 3 21 8 24 5 25 14 18 12 29 11 32 2 19 10 27 0 23 16 17 31

string-manipulation					Programming Challenge Description:  Develop a service to help a client quickly find a manager who can resolve the conflict between two employees. When there is a conflict between two employees, the closest common manager should help resolve the conflict. The developers plan to test the service by providing an example reporting hierarchy to enable the identification of the closest common manager for two employees. Your goal is to develop an algorithm for IBM to efficiently perform this task. To keep things simple, they just use a single relationship "isManagerOf" between any two employees. For example, consider a reporting structure represented as a set of triples:  Tom isManagerOf Mary Mary isManagerOf Bob Mary isManagerOf Sam Bob isManagerOf John Sam isManagerOf Pete Sam isManagerOf Katie  The manager who should resolve the conflict between Bob and Mary is Tom(Mary's manager). The manager who should resolve the conflict between Pete and Katie is Sam(both employees' manager). The manager who should resolve the conflict between Bob and Pete is Mary(Bob's manager and Pete's manager's manager).   Assumptions: There will be at least one isManagerOf relationship. There can be a maximum of 15 team member to a single manager No cross management would exist i.e., a person can have only one manager There can be a maximum of 100 levels of manager relationships in the corporation  Input:  R1,R2,R3,R4...Rn,Person1,Person2 R1...Rn - A comma separated list of "isManagerOf" relationships. Each relationship being represented by an arrow "Manager->Person". Person1,Person2 - The name of the two employee that have conflict Output:  The name of the manager who can resolve the conflict Note: Please be prepared to provide a video follow-up response to describe your approach to this exercise.  Test 1: Test Input  Frank->Mary,Mary->Sam,Mary->Bob,Sam->Katie,Sam->Pete,Bob->John,Bob,Katie   Expected Output  Mary   Test 2: Test Input  Sam->Pete,Pete->Nancy,Sam->Katie,Mary->Bob,Frank->Mary,Mary->Sam,Bob->John,Sam,John  Expected Output  Mary

system-design					Write a Program for Dictionary which has functionality of lookup and insert . This program should be able to add words on the fly   I wrote simple code using HashTable   follow up   1) Now we are getting too many words what happens  me: Hashtable will dynamically resize resulting into performance hit . Also they might get hashed to same location as well as we might run out of main memory   2) Okay you are out of main memory , How will you scale this program  me: I will create buckets of HashTable lets say 26 buckets for one for each alphabet and would put them on different machines   3) Lets say you are out of memory on those machines too  me: Okay I need to put them on secondary storage . Here we can have fileSystem or Database . I chose database . I will create simple DB schema of BucketNumber and word .   I will use buckets on main memory as cache , if we are not able to find a word in the bucket then query databse with bucket number and words then remove the least number times looked up word (every time we lookup a word we increament the count i.e value in key,value pair on hashtable) from that bucket and add this word .   I mentioned that bottleneck in this case will be every time a word is not present we need to query DB which usually has high latency which will result into performance hit   4) Lets say we are okay with latency but what if we are getting inserting words between that are only between only in two buckets ex. words starting from a and b only.  Now that I think about it, is it better to do this in a trie? What do you guys think?
